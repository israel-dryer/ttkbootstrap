# Repo overview

ttkbootstrap is a themed widget framework and application toolkit built
on top of Tk. The library lives under `src/ttkbootstrap/` and ships
widgets, dialogs, a styling engine, data sources, an i18n stack, and an
application runtime.

The public API surface is the union of:

- `src/ttkbootstrap/__init__.py` — top-level lazy re-exports.
- `src/ttkbootstrap/api/*.py` — grouped public exports (app, widgets,
  style, dialogs, data, i18n, utils, menu, localization).

Anything not surfaced through those modules is internal.

## Active work: docs review and cleanup

A multi-phase documentation overhaul is in progress on branch
`docs/review-and-cleanup`. The source of truth is:

- `analysis/docs-review-and-plan.md`

Read that first when picking up any docs work. It captures:

- the documentation model (user-guide pages vs API-spec pages),
- the docstring template (Google style, plain Markdown),
- the conventions (no `bootstyle` in narrative, examples off by default,
  "spec, not user guide" — mechanical not editorial),
- the per-symbol status of the priority API surface,
- the phased plan and the decisions log.

Do not re-derive any of those from scratch — propose updates to the
plan doc instead so they survive across sessions.

### Current handoff (2026-04-29)

Phases 1–5 and 7 are complete. The only remaining work is **Phase 6
(screenshot pipeline)**. See the plan doc for full task status.

**Phase 6 overview.** All tasks require either a judgment call or a
running Tk display:

- **6A** — image policy decision (one judgment call): mandatory per
  widget page, or case-by-case?
- **6B** — manifest design: unify the 7 existing `docs_scripts/*.py`
  into a single `render.py` driven by a YAML/TOML manifest.
- **6C** — add `make screenshots` / `ttkb screenshots` command
  (depends on 6B).
- **6D** — CI check: every `docs/widgets/**/*.md` that references an
  image must have that image on disk. Can be done without a display.
- **6E** — generate screenshots for ~67 widget pages currently without
  them; replace the 15 `IMAGE:` placeholders (needs display).
- **6F** — MP4/GIF for animated widgets: Toast, Tooltip, Accordion,
  Expander, PageStack, FloodGauge, Meter (needs display + recording).

**Model selection.** Use Opus for 6A and 6B (judgment/architecture).
Sonnet is fine for 6C and 6D. 6E/6F require a display environment.

## Documentation toolchain

- **MkDocs (Zensical)**, not Sphinx. Configuration: `zensical.toml`.
- **Plain Markdown only** in docstrings — no reST roles like `:func:`,
  `:param:`, or `.. note::`. The MkDocs `admonition` extension is
  enabled, so `!!! note "Heading"` blocks are allowed in docstrings.
- **mkdocstrings** renders the API reference from source docstrings
  using the Google convention. Reference pages are bare
  `::: module.Class` directives. Class docstrings carry narrative and
  `Attributes:`; `__init__` docstrings carry `Args:`. Both render —
  don't relocate, fill gaps.

## Linting and validation

Public-API docstring discipline is enforced by ruff `D` rules with the
Google convention, configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`.
Run from the repo root:

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check src/ttkbootstrap
```

Internal directories (`widgets/mixins`, `widgets/internal`,
`widgets/parts`, `style/builders`, `style/builders_tk`,
`core/capabilities`, `core/mixins`, `cli`, `assets`) are blanket-ignored
in `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]`.

Public-surface files whose docstrings haven't yet been brought to spec
are listed individually in the same block. Each entry is removed once
that file passes:

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check --select D --isolated src/ttkbootstrap/path/to/file.py
```

Use `--isolated` to bypass `pyproject.toml` and see the real violations
the ignore is currently suppressing.

## Conventions

- One canonical import in examples: `import ttkbootstrap as ttk`.
- The `bootstyle` parameter is **deprecated**. In descriptive prose,
  describe styling via the canonical tokens (`accent`, `variant`,
  `density`, `surface`, `show_border`). The `bootstyle` parameter is
  still marked DEPRECATED in argument docs for users who haven't
  migrated.
- Class docstrings describe what something **is** and **does**
  mechanically. Don't write "when to use this," "best for…," or
  comparisons to sibling classes — those belong in user-guide pages
  under `docs/widgets/` or `docs/guides/`.
- Examples in docstrings are off by default. Add an `Examples:` section
  only when the call shape is non-obvious from the signature alone
  (decorators, context managers, abstract subclassing patterns,
  ambiguous polymorphic args). "Construct it and pack it" doesn't
  qualify.

## Branches and commits

- Active feature work for v2 lives on `release/v2`.
- The docs review effort lives on `docs/review-and-cleanup`.
- Commit messages on this branch use the format
  `Docs review phase N: <summary>` for phase-scoped commits and
  `Docs: <summary>` for individual file cleanups.
