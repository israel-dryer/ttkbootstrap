Guidance for working in the ttkbootstrap repository.

## What this is

ttkbootstrap is a theming extension for tkinter/ttk: it generates modern,
flat, Bootstrap-inspired themes on demand and adds a `bootstyle` keyword
API to ttk widgets. Pure Python; the only runtime dependency is Pillow
(used for image-based widget assets). Public API entry point is
`src/ttkbootstrap/__init__.py`, typically imported as `import ttkbootstrap as ttk`.

- Package version / metadata: `pyproject.toml` (src layout, `requires-python >=3.10`).
- Docs site: mkdocs (`mkdocs.yml`, `docs/`), published to readthedocs.

## Direction: 2.0 cleanup (read before large changes)

The active initiative is a **2.0 cleanup/consolidation release — no new
features.** Goals: remove cruft, standardize/normalize the API (aggressive/
breaking is OK when meaningful, paired with a migration path), fix memory leaks
and theme-switch perf, make user-defined custom styles easy, and overhaul the
docs. ttkbootstrap stays a **styling extension for vanilla tkinter** — not a
widget library (the forward-looking framework is a separate project, bootstack).

The full worklist (locked decisions + workstreams) lives in
**`development/2_0_plan.md`**, and the integration branch is **`2.0`** (cut PRs
against it, not `master`). Headlines: mixin-hybrid API (replace the import-time
monkey-patch), single canonical `bootstyle` string (no tuple/list/alt-order),
semantic-anchor theme model, deterministic version-stamped theme walk +
image-cache cleanup (mechanisms borrowed from bootstack, not its API), and a
centralized compat quarantine for all legacy normalization + deprecation
warnings. Consult that doc before starting 2.0 work.

**Current handoff state** (read `development/2_0_handoff.md` first): all the
independent cleanup slices are **merged** into `2.0` — deprecated top-level shims
removed + headless/demo test split (#1068), public/internal split (#1069),
widget lifecycle-leak fixes (Workstream B, #1070), `FloodgaugeLegacy` runtime
`DeprecationWarning` (#1071), and the `examples/` `test_`-prefix rename (#1072).
The engine keystone (Workstream A) is now in progress: the design is locked in
`development/2_0_engine_design.md`, and **PR 1 — the repaint engine** (version
-stamped theme walk replacing `Publisher`, lazy per-theme style rebuild,
single-root `RuntimeError`) is **merged** into `2.0` (#1073). **PR 2** — the
content-addressed image cache (`Style._image_cache` + `_get_or_create_image` +
`clear_image_cache`; per-builder `theme_images` leak removed) — is **merged**
into `2.0` (#1074). That **completes the engine (Workstream A) keystone**.
**PR 3** — the mixin API (Workstream C) — is **implemented** on
`feat/2.0-pr3-mixin-api` (awaiting merge): the import-time monkey-patch is
retired in favor of concrete `BootMixin`/`AutoStyleMixin` subclasses re-exported
from `__init__.py`, plus `bootify`/`apply_bootstyle`/opt-in `enable_global_api`;
the ~450-line `TYPE_CHECKING` stub block + `__init__.pyi` are deleted. Next is
the `style/` split (G, where the public style toolkit lands) → theme/anchor (E) +
bootstyle canonical (D). Proceed PR by PR per the design doc; don't exceed a
PR's scope without revisiting it.

## Repository layout

```
src/ttkbootstrap/
  __init__.py        # public exports; defines the concrete BootMixin/AutoStyleMixin widget
                     #   subclasses (e.g. `class Button(BootMixin, ttk.Button)`) that carry the
                     #   `bootstyle`/`autostyle` api. No import-time monkey-patch (2.0, PR 3) —
                     #   opt into it via enable_global_api().
  style.py           # THE CORE — theme/style engine (see below). Largest, most important file.

### internal/ vs public (important — new in 2.0)

Implementation-detail modules live in **`src/ttkbootstrap/internal/`** (the
name is `internal`, *not* `_internal`). Anything under it has no
back-compat guarantee.

When moving something public→internal, leave a thin shim at the old public path
that re-exports from `internal/` and emits a `DeprecationWarning` ("…moved to
ttkbootstrap.internal.X; removed in 3.0") — e.g. `ttkbootstrap.publisher`. For a
module that stays public but sheds internal helpers (e.g. `utility.py`), forward
the moved names via module-level `__getattr__` with the same warning instead of
a whole shim module. **Importing `ttkbootstrap` itself must stay warning-free**
— shims warn only when an old path is actually used.

The older top-level shims (`ttkbootstrap.scrolled/tableview/toast/tooltip`,
`dialogs/dialogs.py`) were **removed** in #1068 — import from
`ttkbootstrap.widgets.<name>` / `ttkbootstrap.dialogs`. Edit real
implementations in `src/ttkbootstrap/widgets/`, never a shim.

## The style engine (`style.py`)

Everything visual flows through here. Key classes:

- **`Style`** — singleton (`Style.get_instance()`), subclasses `ttk.Style`.
  Owns theme definitions, the active theme, and the style registry
  (`_style_registry`, `_theme_styles`). `theme_use()` switches themes and
  rebuilds every registered style.
- **`StyleBuilderTTK`** — holds `create_*_style(colorname)` methods (e.g.
  `create_button_style`, `create_outline_toolbutton_style`). These build a
  ttk style and call `_register_ttkstyle()`.
- **`StyleBuilderTK`** — styles legacy `tk.*` widgets (Menu, Text, Canvas, …).
- **`Bootstyle`** — the resolver: `update_ttk_widget_style()` maps a
  `bootstyle=`/`style=` string to a built ttk style. Two delivery paths feed it
  (2.0, PR 3): the default `BootMixin`/`AutoStyleMixin` concrete subclasses
  (in `__init__.py`), and the opt-in global monkey-patch
  (`enable_global_api()` → `setup_ttkbootstrap_api()`).

### Lazy style building — the model to keep in mind

Styles are built **on demand**, not up front. The base `TButton`, `TEntry`,
etc. are only configured the first time a widget that needs them is created
(or via `_create_ttk_styles_on_theme_change` for already-registered styles).
At theme load, `create_default_style()` configures the root `.` style plus a
small set of always-needed styles.

Consequence (and a real past bug, #1062): native/third-party ttk widgets the
app never instantiates directly — e.g. the `ttk::button` widgets inside Tk's
file dialog on Linux — fall back to the bare clam look if no corresponding
ttkbootstrap widget has been created. The fix pattern is to build the needed
base style eagerly in `create_default_style()`.

## Gotchas

- **`Style` is a process-wide singleton (`Style.instance`) tied to the first Tk
  root.** Creating and destroying separate roots in one process leaves the
  singleton mis-bound, so later theming silently no-ops. Tests share ONE root
  via the `root` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` — see "Writing tests" below.
  (Properly fixing the singleton is part of the deferred `style.py` engine
  rewrite.)
- **Themes are clam-derived** (`theme_create(name, TTK_CLAM)`). An unstyled
  base ttk style shows clam's default appearance until ttkbootstrap configures it.

## Dev environment & commands

A virtualenv with an editable install lives at `.venv/` (Python 3.x on macOS;
`python` on PATH resolves to it). The package is also importable with
`PYTHONPATH=src`.

- Run the headless suite: `python -m pytest -q` (config in `pyproject.toml`
  under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`; `testpaths = ["tests"]`).
- pytest is installed in `.venv`. If a fresh env lacks it: `pip install pytest`.
- The interactive demos in `examples/` call `mainloop()` and need a display —
  they are NOT collected by pytest.
- Build docs: `mkdocs serve` (deps in `requirements.txt`).

### Writing tests

`tests/` is headless-only. New GUI tests should **take the `root` fixture** from
`tests/conftest.py` (one shared session root; widgets and theme are reset per
test) instead of creating their own `ttk.Window` — creating your own root
re-triggers the singleton mis-binding above. Query a built style's value with
`app.tk.call("ttk::style", "lookup", "<Style>", "-<option>")`. Put any
interactive/visual demo in `examples/`, not `tests/`.

## Conventions

- Match the style of the file you're editing (comment density, naming).
- Custom widgets that need image assets generate them through the style
  builder / Pillow pipeline; favor native ttk/clam mechanisms over images
  where both are viable (perf and cross-platform consistency).
- Commit messages: imperative subject; reference the issue (`fixes #NNNN`)
  where applicable.
- Branch + PR per change. **2.0 cleanup work targets the `2.0` branch**;
  maintenance/bugfixes target `master`.
