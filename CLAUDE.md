# Repo overview

ttkbootstrap is a themed widget framework and application toolkit built
on top of Tk. The library lives under `src/ttkbootstrap/` and ships
widgets, dialogs, a styling engine, data sources, an i18n stack, and an
application runtime.

The public API surface is the union of:

- `src/ttkbootstrap/__init__.py` — top-level lazy re-exports.
- `src/ttkbootstrap/api/*.py` — grouped public exports (app, widgets,
  style, dialogs, data, i18n, utils, menu, localization).

Anything not surfaced through those modules is internal.

## Active work: docs review and cleanup

A multi-phase documentation overhaul is in progress on branch
`docs/review-and-cleanup`. The source of truth is:

- `analysis/docs-review-and-plan.md`

Read that first when picking up any docs work. It captures:

- the documentation model (user-guide pages vs API-spec pages),
- the docstring template (Google style, plain Markdown),
- the conventions (no `bootstyle` in narrative, examples off by default,
  "spec, not user guide" — mechanical not editorial),
- the per-symbol status of the priority API surface,
- the phased plan and the decisions log.

Do not re-derive any of those from scratch — propose updates to the
plan doc instead so they survive across sessions.

### Current handoff (2026-04-30, data-display sweep — 1/8 + template restructure)

Phases 1–7, 9A–9D are complete. **Phase 6 (screenshot pipeline) is partially
complete; 6F not started. Pass 2 (editorial review) is the active work —
the dialogs sweep is now complete (11/11), and the data-display sweep
has begun: the data-display template has been restructured to the slim
arc and `label.md` is the canonical anchor. Remaining 7 pages (badge,
floodgauge, listview, meter, progressbar, tableview, treeview) still
need rewriting.**

### Template arc (apply to every editorial sweep)

The `widget-input-template.md` arc (Basic usage → Value model → API →
guidance) is now the universal pattern. When opening any new sweep,
audit the category's template against these principles before
touching pages:

1. **Lead with `Basic usage` after the intro.** No `Framework
   integration` lead — its content distributes into Common options,
   Behavior, Events, and Localization & reactivity.
2. **A category-appropriate mental-model section sits right after
   Basic usage** (Value model / Result value / Data model /
   Lifecycle / Selection model / Navigation model / Form model).
   Action widgets don't get one — `command` isn't a model.
3. **API consolidates into `Common options` / `Behavior` / `Events`.**
   Don't fragment with separate `Styling`, `Localization`, or
   `Binding to signals` H2s — those go inline or into Common options.
4. **`What problem it solves` and `Core concepts` are padding by
   default.** Drop them; bring back per-page only when there's
   substantive content the other sections can't carry.
5. **`When should I use X?` sits near the bottom** — readers see the
   API before the recommendation.
6. **Optional sections** are marked with `*Optional` italic prose
   under the heading; `tools/check_doc_structure.py` drops those from
   the required list.

Templates already restructured to this arc:
- `widget-input-template.md` (was already correct — anchored on
  `textentry.md`).
- `widget-dialog-template.md` (commit `7667e36`).
- `widget-action-template.md` (commit `7667e36`).
- `widget-data-display-template.md` (commit `6dae13a`, anchored on
  `label.md`). `Data model` and `Performance guidance` are
  `*Optional` so simple display widgets (Label, Badge, Progressbar,
  Floodgauge, Meter) skip them while data-bound widgets (TableView,
  TreeView, ListView) fill them in.

Remaining 5 templates (form, layout, navigation, overlay,
selection) still lead with `Framework integration` etc. Apply the
editorial pass at the start of each category's sweep — those
categories have 0 pages written, so the template fix is free.

Phase 6 status (for reference):

- **6A–6E — DONE.** Image policy locked, renderer scaffold built, CLI wired,
  image-check tool added, in-frame shots rendered for all visible widget pages
  (13 batches). Shots are macOS placeholders; re-render on Windows for canonical
  assets (`python -m docs_scripts.render` on a Windows host overwrites every asset).
- **6F — NOT STARTED.** Popup and animated widgets need capture tooling beyond
  the in-frame model. See `analysis/docs-review-and-plan.md` § Phase 6F for the
  full list and the renderer mode needed.

Phase 9 (drift sweep) — DONE:

- `tools/check_doc_snippets.py` validates all 833 `python` blocks across 107
  docs files (compile check always; runtime check with `--run`). Currently 0
  failures. Run this before and after any docs edit to guard against regression.
- 22 doc files were fixed in Pass 1 (wrong class names, constructor kwargs,
  option names, theme names). See plan doc § Phase 9 for the full list.
- `OptionMenu(command=)` and `DropdownButton(command=)` now work (9C).
- `ttk.ListView` is now a public export (9D).

Open items from earlier phases (do not lose track):

- **8B** — `ListView.badge` field silently dropped in `update_data`
  (`listitem.py:725`). Code fix: add `"badge": self._update_badge` to the
  dispatch map.
- **8C** — Rendered docstring review for 22 priority symbols (needs display).

### Now: Pass 2 — Editorial review (Opus, one guide per session)

Pass 1 is done; every snippet is known to match the current API. Pass 2 is
the active work. Goal: each guide is best-in-class for its content type.

**All 14 guides in `docs/guides/` are done** (2026-04-30). Widget pages
in progress; platform/capabilities pages still to come.

**Widget pages — actions** (`docs/widgets/actions/`) — **DONE 2026-04-30
(re-reviewed against slim template).**

All 5 pages restructured to the slim action template (commit
`0fed5b8`): leading `Framework integration` dropped, `Appearance`
folded into `Common options` (with an option-summary table at the
top), real `Events` section added per page, `When to use` renamed
and moved near the bottom as `When should I use WidgetName?`,
`Additional resources` split into `Related widgets` + `Reference`.

`button.md` is the canonical anchor for the new action-page shape;
the other four (`buttongroup.md`, `contextmenu.md`,
`dropdownbutton.md`, `menubutton.md`) follow it.

`tools/check_doc_structure.py --category actions` → 5/5 pass.

**Widget pages — inputs** (`docs/widgets/inputs/`, 10 pages) — **DONE 2026-04-30.**

All 10 pages reviewed against `docs/_template/widget-input-template.md`.
Inputs use a **different template** than actions — don't carry the
actions section names over verbatim.

Last session (2026-04-30):

- `scrolledtext.md` — restructured to template; clarified that
  `ScrolledText` has **no `value`/signal/variable model** (it wraps
  `tkinter.Text`), corrected the existing claim that the container
  themes via `accent` (it's `scrollbar_style`), documented the
  delegation surface (Text methods copied at construct time, plus
  `__getattr__` fallback to `self._text`), and replaced the wrong
  default in the old Quick start (default `scrollbar_visibility` is
  `'always'`, not `'scroll'`).

Prior session (2026-04-30, two-page batch):

- `scale.md` — restructured to template; corrected event hooks
  (Scale exposes `command` / `signal.subscribe` / `<ButtonRelease-1>`,
  *not* `on_input`/`on_changed`); removed non-existent `step` option.
- `labeledscale.md` — restructured to template; clarified that
  `accent` only styles the inner scale, that `signal=` is rejected
  (use `widget.scale.signal` for reactive subs), and that range
  reconfiguration must go through the inner scale (the
  `LabeledScale.configure(minvalue=…)` path is broken — see bugs list).

`tools/check_doc_structure.py --category inputs` → 10/10 pass.

Template: `docs/_template/widget-input-template.md`. Required H2s:

- `Basic usage`
- `Value model` *(what `value` means, live vs committed changes,
  empty/none/invalid representation, signal vs variable)*
- `Common options` *(curated, not an API dump)*
- `Behavior` *(widget-specific: formatting, filtering, popup, stepping…)*
- `Events` *(`on_input` for live, `on_changed` for committed)*
- `Validation and constraints`
- `When should I use WidgetName?`
- `Related widgets`
- `Reference`

Pages to review:

- [x] `textentry.md` — **canonical input pattern**; use this as the
      reference for the inputs sweep, the way `button.md` anchored actions
- [x] `numericentry.md`
- [x] `passwordentry.md`
- [x] `pathentry.md`
- [x] `dateentry.md`
- [x] `timeentry.md`
- [x] `spinnerentry.md`
- [x] `scale.md`
- [x] `labeledscale.md`
- [x] `scrolledtext.md`

**Widget pages — dialogs** (`docs/widgets/dialogs/`, 11 pages) —
**DONE 2026-04-30 (11/11).**

Template: `docs/_template/widget-dialog-template.md` (slim arc,
restructured commit `7667e36`). Required H2s: `Basic usage`,
`Result value`, `Common options`, `Behavior`, `Events`,
`When should I use WidgetName?`, `Additional resources` (with
sub-bullets for Related widgets / Framework concepts / API
reference). Optional via `*Optional` prose: `UX guidance`.

`messagedialog.md` is the canonical anchor for the dialogs sweep.
The other 10 (`messagebox.md`, `querydialog.md`, `querybox.md`,
`formdialog.md`, `dialog.md`, `datedialog.md`, `colorchooser.md`,
`colordropper.md`, `fontdialog.md`, `filterdialog.md`) follow it.

`tools/check_doc_structure.py --category dialogs` → 11/11 pass.

Patterns / non-obvious behavior worth remembering across the
dialogs surface (full per-session detail lives in commit messages):

- `MessageDialog`, `FormDialog`, `FilterDialog` all default to
  translation-key button labels (`button.ok` / `button.cancel`)
  but have **no `localize` flag** — vanilla construction shows
  literal key strings. (Bugs list.)
- `<<DialogResult>>` event payload is `{"result": ..., "confirmed":
  bool}`; `on_dialog_result` helper passes the **full payload
  dict**, not the unwrapped result.
- `Dialog` (base) does NOT fire `<<DialogResult>>` and has no
  `on_dialog_result` helper — those are added by subclasses.
- `ColorDropperDialog.show()` is **non-blocking** (no
  `wait_window()`) — unlike every other dialog. Callers must
  trace the `result` Variable, register `on_dialog_result` after
  `show()`, or use `wait_variable()` manually.
- `FilterDialog` is a `Frame` subclass that *composes* a Dialog
  on `show()`, not a Dialog subclass — events fire on the frame,
  the event surface uses `<<SelectionChange>>` with payload
  `{"selected": list}` instead of the framework-standard
  `<<DialogResult>>`. (Bugs list.)
- `FontDialog.default_font` is a **named-font name string**
  (`"TkDefaultFont"`), NOT a `Font` instance.

(Per-session detail for each dialog rewrite — including the
specific old-page errors corrected and bug numbers surfaced — is
captured in the commit messages on `docs/review-and-cleanup`. See
`Docs: editorial review — <DialogName> ...` from 2026-04-30.)

### Now: Widget pages — data-display (`docs/widgets/data-display/`, 8 pages)

Template: `docs/_template/widget-data-display-template.md`
(restructured to slim arc commit `6dae13a`). Required H2s:

- `Basic usage`
- `Common options`
- `Behavior`
- `Events`
- `When should I use WidgetName?`
- `Related widgets`
- `Reference`

Optional (declared via `*Optional` prose under the heading):

- `Data model` — required for data-bound widgets (TableView,
  TreeView, ListView). Skip for read-only status/progress
  widgets (Label, Badge, Progressbar, Floodgauge, Meter).
- `Performance guidance` — include for widgets that scale with
  row count. Skip for lightweight status/progress widgets.

Last session (2026-04-30, label sweep — anchor):

- `label.md` rewritten to the slim template as the canonical
  anchor for the data-display sweep. Frames Label as the
  foundational read-only display widget that Badge, Field
  labels, and several composites are built on. Contrasts
  against `Button` (no `command`, `takefocus=False` by default)
  and `Entry` (no value model — Label displays whatever is
  bound to its `text`).
  Common-options consolidates into a single 16-row table
  covering the everyday surface: text content (`text` /
  `textvariable` / `textsignal` are equivalent input slots —
  framework normalizes a Signal passed to `text=` into the
  `textsignal` slot), images (`image` / `icon` / `icon_only` /
  `compound`), layout (`anchor` / `justify` / `wraplength`),
  theming (`accent` / `surface` / `font` / `padding`),
  localization (`localize` / `value_format`), and `state`. The
  old page split these across Quick start, Appearance,
  Examples & patterns, and Localization.
  Three subtleties surfaced in narrative: (1) `accent` controls
  the **foreground** color, NOT a chip background — readers
  expecting a high-contrast pill are routed to Badge;
  (2) Label has no `on_*` event helpers and emits no virtual
  events — reactivity goes the other direction (bind a
  `Signal`/`Variable` to `text`); click handling needs a manual
  `bind("<Button-1>", ...)` or `Button` with a borderless
  variant; (3) `accent` overrides foreground via
  `b.color(accent)` while `surface` drives background, so
  `surface=` is the right knob if you need a colored background
  on a Label.
  Behavior section documents the `state` semantics from
  `TtkStateMixin` (`disabled` dims, other states accepted but
  rarely visually distinct on a label), the wraplength/anchor
  sizing rules, and the `<<LocaleChanged>>` re-translation
  behavior with `value_format` formatting hooked through
  `IntlFormatter`.

`tools/check_doc_structure.py --category data-display` → 1/8
passing (label only). 7 remaining pages (badge, floodgauge,
listview, meter, progressbar, tableview, treeview) are still on
the old scaffold.

Pages to review (canonical anchor: `label.md`):

- [x] `label.md` — anchor for the data-display sweep
- [ ] `badge.md` — extends Label; compact pill chip
- [ ] `progressbar.md`
- [ ] `floodgauge.md`
- [ ] `meter.md`
- [ ] `listview.md` — first data-bound widget; uses Data model
- [ ] `tableview.md`
- [ ] `treeview.md`

### Workflow (one page per session)

1. Read the page end-to-end.
2. Find the right template under `docs/_template/`.
3. Rewrite in one pass.
4. `python tools/check_doc_structure.py --category <cat>` and
   `python tools/check_doc_snippets.py --run --file <page>` — both
   must pass.
5. Commit: `Docs: editorial review — <page title>`.

The structure check substitutes the literal `WidgetName` in the
template's H2s with the page's H1, so a page can use
`## When should I use TextEntry?` and still satisfy the template's
`## When should I use WidgetName?` requirement.

Run **one page at a time** as a deliberate session. Each session covers:

- **Structural fit** — does the page follow the right template for its content
  type? Use `python tools/check_doc_structure.py` (from Phase 5I) to flag
  missing required H2s, then judge the rest.
- **Accuracy** — snippets are clean, but does the *narrative* match the API?
  (Methods that no longer exist, options whose semantics changed.)
- **Completeness** — are concepts a good docs site would cover present?
- **Clarity** — framing, ordering, jargon.

Architectural pages (`platform/*`, `capabilities/*`, `design-system/*`,
`reference/*/index.md`) — same treatment, stronger weight on accuracy.

**Session workflow:**
1. Read the page end-to-end. Note gaps.
2. Rewrite in one pass.
3. `python tools/check_doc_snippets.py --run --file <page>` — confirm 0 failures.
4. Commit: `Docs: editorial review — <page title>`.

**Widget page priority** — do actions, inputs, dialogs, and data-display first
(highest user traffic); then layout, navigation, overlays, selection, views,
primitives.

**Bugs surfaced during guide review** (logged in plan, not yet fixed):
- `AppSettings.light_theme`/`dark_theme` defaults are `docs-light`/`docs-dark`
  (counterintuitive; should probably be `bootstrap-light`/`bootstrap-dark`)
- `follow_system_appearance` is silently no-op on Windows/Linux
- `ListView` calls `deselect_all()`/`is_selected()` on its datasource but
  `BaseDataSource` exposes `unselect_all()`/no `is_selected` — mismatch
- `Signal.map()` uses weakref; inline `textvariable=sig.map(fn)` can stop
  updating after the derived signal is GC'd
- `MessageDialog._parse_buttons` stores the `:role` suffix into deprecated
  `bootstyle` field instead of `accent`
- `ValidationMixin.on_valid`/`on_invalid`/`on_validated` callbacks receive
  the payload `dict` directly, while `TextEntryPart.on_input`/`on_changed`/
  `on_enter` callbacks receive a virtual event with `.data`. The two
  registration paths — direct `bind(...)` vs. `_on_*_command` slots
  dispatched through `_dispatch_*` — produce inconsistent callback shapes.
  Either wrap the validation handlers to fire `callback(event)` so all
  `on_*` helpers are uniform, or document the split prominently. (Surfaced
  by textentry.md rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `DateEntry` class docstring (`composites/dateentry.py:30`) lists
  `monthAndDate` as a preset; the actual `IntlFormatter` preset is
  `monthAndDay`. Source-only typo. (Surfaced by dateentry.md rewrite,
  2026-04-30.)
- `TimeEntry.__init__` docstring (`composites/timeentry.py:67`) lists
  `"mediumTime"` as a value-format preset, but it isn't defined in
  `IntlFormatter.DatePreset`. Source-only typo — `shortTime`/`longTime`
  are the real medium/long pair. (Surfaced by timeentry.md rewrite,
  2026-04-30.)
- `LabeledScale` configure delegators have inverted query/set branches:
  `_delegate_value`, `_delegate_minvalue`, `_delegate_maxvalue` (and
  `_delegate_dtype`) at `composites/labeledscale.py:148-177` all check
  `if value is not None: return …` (set path returns the current value
  instead of writing) `else: self.configure(from_=value)` (query path
  attempts to write `None`). Net effect: `widget.configure(value=…)`,
  `widget.configure(minvalue=…)`, `widget.configure(maxvalue=…)`, and
  `widget.cget("minvalue"/"maxvalue"/"value")` are all broken. Workarounds:
  set the property (`widget.value = …`) and reconfigure the inner scale
  (`widget.scale.configure(from_=…, to=…)`). Source bug. (Surfaced by
  labeledscale.md rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `MessageDialog` class docstring (`dialogs/message.py:27-28`) claims
  `show_info` / `show_warning` / `show_error` / `show_question` are
  static methods on `MessageDialog` itself, but those methods live on
  `MessageBox`. Source-only docstring error. (Surfaced by
  messagedialog.md rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `MessageDialog` default `buttons=None` resolves to the translation
  keys `["button.cancel", "button.ok"]` (`dialogs/message.py:75-82`),
  but `localize` is also off by default. A vanilla `MessageDialog()`
  therefore displays the literal strings `button.cancel` /
  `button.ok` to the end user. Either default `localize=True` or
  resolve through `MessageCatalog.translate` unconditionally for the
  built-in semantic keys. (Surfaced by messagedialog.md rewrite,
  2026-04-30.)
- `FormDialog` class docstring (`dialogs/formdialog.py:55`) says
  `resizable` defaults to `(True, True)`, but the signature default
  (`formdialog.py:77`) is `False` — which gets normalized to
  `(False, False)`. So a vanilla `FormDialog()` is non-resizable,
  contrary to the class docstring. Source-only docstring/signature
  mismatch — fix the docstring to match the signature, or change
  the default. (Surfaced by formdialog.md rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `FormDialog` shares the same default-button localization gotcha as
  `MessageDialog`: `dialogs/formdialog.py:507-509` defaults to
  `["button.cancel", "button.ok"]` translation keys, and there is
  no `localize` flag on `FormDialog` at all. The vanilla
  `FormDialog()` therefore shows literal `button.cancel` /
  `button.ok` strings to the user. Plumb a `localize` argument
  through (or resolve the built-in semantic keys
  unconditionally). (Surfaced by formdialog.md rewrite,
  2026-04-30.)
- `FormDialog.show()` always overwrites `self.result` with
  `form.data` whenever the underlying `_dialog.result` is not None
  (`dialogs/formdialog.py:204-208`). This means a custom button's
  `result=` value is silently ignored — callers who want to route
  on which submit button was pressed (e.g. "Save" vs "Save and
  close") have no way to read it back from `.result`. Either honor
  button `result=` overrides, or document that custom button-result
  routing isn't supported on FormDialog. (Surfaced by formdialog.md
  rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `DateDialog.on_result` callback receives the **full payload
  dict**, not the unwrapped date. The docstring at
  `dialogs/datedialog.py:368` claims "The callback receives
  `event.data["result"]` (a `datetime.date`)", but the handler
  (`dialogs/datedialog.py:382-383`) actually invokes
  `callback(getattr(event, "data", None))` — passing
  `{"result": date, "confirmed": True}`. Either unwrap the payload
  in the handler or fix the docstring. The same `on_result`
  binding target is `self._dialog.toplevel or self._master`, so
  registering before `show()` with no `master=` silently no-ops
  (returns None) — match QueryDialog's gotcha. (Surfaced by
  datedialog.md rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `FilterDialog.show()` does **not** reset `self.result` to `None` at
  the start of each call (`dialogs/filterdialog.py:290-358`). Only
  the underlying `Dialog`'s own `result` is reset. If a single
  FilterDialog instance is used across multiple openings, a sequence
  of [OK with selection X] → [reopen, then Cancel] returns the stale
  list X instead of `None`. Either reset `self.result = None` at the
  top of `show()`, or document that callers must reconstruct the
  dialog per opening. (Surfaced by filterdialog.md rewrite,
  2026-04-30.)
- `FilterDialog` shares the localized-default-button gotcha with
  `MessageDialog` and `FormDialog`: the OK/Cancel buttons default to
  the translation keys `"button.ok"` / `"button.cancel"`
  (`dialogs/filterdialog.py:333-340`), and there is no `localize`
  flag at all. The Select All checkbox label is also a translation
  key (`"edit.select_all"`, `dialogs/filterdialog.py:108`). A vanilla
  `FilterDialog(items=[...], enable_select_all=True)` therefore
  shows literal `button.ok` / `button.cancel` / `edit.select_all`
  strings to the user. Plumb a `localize` flag through, or resolve
  the built-in semantic keys unconditionally. (Surfaced by
  filterdialog.md rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `FilterDialogContent._handle_select_all`
  (`dialogs/filterdialog.py:142-149`) iterates **all** registered
  checkboxes, ignoring the current search filter. If the user types
  a search term and clicks Select All, every item — including the
  ones not currently visible due to the filter — is selected/
  deselected. Either restrict Select All to visible items only, or
  hide the Select All toggle when a search filter is active. Also,
  the Select All checkbox does not auto-update its own state when
  individual items are toggled, so its visible state can desync
  from "all items selected" reality. (Surfaced by filterdialog.md
  rewrite, 2026-04-30.)
- `FilterDialogContent._check_buttons`
  (`dialogs/filterdialog.py:140`) is keyed by item `text`, not by
  index or `value`. Items with duplicate `text` fields silently
  overwrite each other in the registry — the second checkbox
  renders, but Select All and the search filter only act on the
  second binding for that key. Key the registry by index (or by
  `value`) instead. (Surfaced by filterdialog.md rewrite,
  2026-04-30.)
- `FilterDialog` is a **`Frame` subclass that composes a `Dialog`**
  rather than extending Dialog directly
  (`dialogs/filterdialog.py:173`). This is inconsistent with every
  other dialog class in the framework and forces unique behavior:
  events fire on the FilterDialog frame instance instead of the
  toplevel; the frame is initialized as a child of `master` but
  never packed; and the event surface uses
  `<<SelectionChange>>` with payload `{"selected": list}` instead
  of the framework-standard `<<DialogResult>>` with payload
  `{"result": ..., "confirmed": bool}`. Consider refactoring to
  extend Dialog directly and aligning event names/payloads with
  the rest of the dialogs surface. (Surfaced by filterdialog.md
  rewrite, 2026-04-30.)

**Renderer conventions** (when authoring new factories — read the
existing `docs_scripts/shots/*.py` for live examples):

- Factory signature: `def factory(parent: Widget) -> Optional[Callable]`.
  `parent` is a renderer-supplied padded `Frame`; build widgets into it.
- Return a `finalize` callable when the shot needs visual state flags
  (`state(["focus"])`, `state(["hover"])`) applied at capture time —
  Tk may otherwise clear them between deiconify and grab.
- Use `widget.focus_set()` for true focus rings; the state flag alone
  isn't always honored by ttk styles.
- **Don't** use `pack_propagate(False)` on a Frame with `width=` but no
  `height=` — height defaults to 0 and the shot renders blank. Either
  set both, or drop the propagate call.
- The renderer deliberately does NOT use `override_redirect=True` or
  `focus_force()` — both kill WM focus event propagation and flatten
  focus/hover visuals.

**Authoring loop for a new widget shot:**

1. Read `docs/widgets/<category>/<name>.md` to find the `IMAGE:`
   placeholder spec or pick a sensible default composition.
2. Add or extend a factory in `docs_scripts/shots/<category>.py`.
3. Add a `[[shots]]` entry to `docs_scripts/screenshots.toml`.
4. Render: `python -m docs_scripts.render --slug widgets-<name>`.
5. View output at `docs/assets/{light,dark}/widgets-<name>.png`.
6. Replace the `IMAGE:` block (or insert a new `<figure markdown>`
   block) in the .md file with the canonical light + dark refs.
7. Run `python tools/check_doc_images.py` to confirm 0 missing.
8. Commit factory + manifest + .md + PNGs together; commit message
   format: `Docs: screenshots for X, Y, Z (6E batch N)`.

The plan doc (`analysis/docs-review-and-plan.md`) has the full
architecture decisions log.

## Documentation toolchain

- **Zensical** (separate from plain MkDocs), not Sphinx. Configuration:
  `zensical.toml`. Install via `pip install -e ".[docs]"`. Serve with
  `.venv/bin/zensical serve -o`.
- **Plain Markdown only** in docstrings — no reST roles like `:func:`,
  `:param:`, or `.. note::`. The MkDocs `admonition` extension is
  enabled, so `!!! note "Heading"` blocks are allowed in docstrings.
- **mkdocstrings** renders the API reference from source docstrings
  using the Google convention. Reference pages are bare
  `::: module.Class` directives. Class docstrings carry narrative and
  `Attributes:`; `__init__` docstrings carry `Args:`. Both render —
  don't relocate, fill gaps.

## Linting and validation

Public-API docstring discipline is enforced by ruff `D` rules with the
Google convention, configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`.
Run from the repo root:

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check src/ttkbootstrap
```

Internal directories (`widgets/mixins`, `widgets/internal`,
`widgets/parts`, `style/builders`, `style/builders_tk`,
`core/capabilities`, `core/mixins`, `cli`, `assets`) are blanket-ignored
in `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]`.

Public-surface files whose docstrings haven't yet been brought to spec
are listed individually in the same block. Each entry is removed once
that file passes:

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check --select D --isolated src/ttkbootstrap/path/to/file.py
```

Use `--isolated` to bypass `pyproject.toml` and see the real violations
the ignore is currently suppressing.

## Conventions

- One canonical import in examples: `import ttkbootstrap as ttk`.
- The `bootstyle` parameter is **deprecated**. In descriptive prose,
  describe styling via the canonical tokens (`accent`, `variant`,
  `density`, `surface`, `show_border`). The `bootstyle` parameter is
  still marked DEPRECATED in argument docs for users who haven't
  migrated.
- Class docstrings describe what something **is** and **does**
  mechanically. Don't write "when to use this," "best for…," or
  comparisons to sibling classes — those belong in user-guide pages
  under `docs/widgets/` or `docs/guides/`.
- Examples in docstrings are off by default. Add an `Examples:` section
  only when the call shape is non-obvious from the signature alone
  (decorators, context managers, abstract subclassing patterns,
  ambiguous polymorphic args). "Construct it and pack it" doesn't
  qualify.
