# Documentation Review and Implementation Plan

Tracking document for the docs overhaul started 2026-04-29. Captures observations, decisions, and the phased plan so progress survives across sessions.

---

## Context

### Goals (from the original ask)

1. The API is fully documented in the API reference.
2. The Platform section is fully explained, accurately cross-referenced, and contains everything expected of a UI platform documentation site.
3. Images and image placeholders are filled in where appropriate or removed.
4. Plus: organization, content, language, and platform-specific feature surfacing.

### Documentation model (decided)

The docs use a deliberate **user-guide vs. API-spec** split, in line with how Python, Rust, and Django document themselves:

- `docs/widgets/`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/capabilities/`, `docs/platform/`, `docs/design-system/` — **user guide**: narrative, examples, when-to-use, screenshots.
- `docs/reference/` — **API spec**: rendered from source docstrings via mkdocstrings (`::: module.Class`). No hand-written narrative.

This means reference-page quality is a function of **docstring quality** in `src/`. The spec is durable only if the docstrings are durable.

### Toolchain

- MkDocs (Zensical config in `zensical.toml`), **not** Sphinx.
- Docstrings: plain Markdown, Google style. **No** reST roles or directives (`:func:`, `:param:`, `.. note::`).
- `[project.plugins.mkdocstrings.handlers.python.options]` in `zensical.toml:399-408` sets `docstring_style = "google"`, `heading_level = 3`, `show_signature = true`.
- Public API surface = `_MODULE_EXPORTS` in `src/ttkbootstrap/__init__.py:164-220` and `_TK_EXPORTS` at `:141-153`.

---

## Observations

### A. API Reference (Goal 1)

Coverage by file count is ~84%. Coverage by *content* depends entirely on docstrings.

**Undocumented public exports** (no reference page):

| Category | Names |
|---|---|
| Tkinter re-exports | `Tk`, `Menu`, `Text`, `Canvas`, `TkFrame`, `Variable`, `StringVar`, `IntVar`, `BooleanVar`, `DoubleVar`, `PhotoImage` |
| App | `Window` (alias for `App`), `Shortcut`, `get_shortcuts` |
| Widgets | `MenuBar`, `SideNavItem`, `SideNavGroup`, `SideNavHeader`, `SideNavSeparator`, `Accordion`, `Badge`, `CheckToggle`, `RadioToggle`, `TK_WIDGETS`, `TTK_WIDGETS` |

**Duplicate reference pages** — the same symbol has multiple URLs:

- `reference/widgets/App.md`, `AppShell.md`, `Toplevel.md`, `Style.md` duplicate canonical pages in `reference/app/`, `reference/style/`.
- All 13 dialog pages (`Dialog.md`, `MessageDialog.md`, `MessageBox.md`, `ColorChooser.md`, `ColorChooserDialog.md`, `ColorDropperDialog.md`, `DateDialog.md`, `FontDialog.md`, `FilterDialog.md`, `FormDialog.md`, `QueryDialog.md`, `QueryBox.md`) appear under both `reference/widgets/` and `reference/dialogs/`.

**Deprecated aliases** (`__init__.py:126-139`) have full reference pages but no deprecation marker:
`NavigationView.md`, `NavigationViewItem.md`, `NavigationViewGroup.md`, `NavigationViewHeader.md`, `NavigationViewSeparator.md`.

**Orphan reference subtree** — `docs/reference/capabilities/` (`bind.md`, `pack.md`, `winfo.md`, `grid.md`, `place.md`, `bindtags.md`, `busy.md`, `clipboard.md`, `focus.md`, `grab.md`, `localization.md`, `selection.md`, `signals.md`, `after.md`) describes Tk methods exposed through mixins. Awkward as pure spec; needs a decision (see Open Questions).

**Off-tree files** — `docs/reference/core/app.md`, `docs/reference/core/style.md` are not in nav.

**Nav config issues** in `zensical.toml`:
- `SideNav` listed twice — line 266 and line 289.
- Lines 267-270 alias `NavigationViewItem.md` etc. as "SideNavItem" — confusing because the file is named for the deprecated alias.

### B. Platform Section (Goal 2)

All 14 pages substantive (~2,270 lines). Cross-referencing strong. Split between Platform (mechanics) and Capabilities (framework features) is articulated in `docs/index.md:93-101` and mostly observed.

**Missing topics expected of a desktop UI platform site:**

| Topic | Current state | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Threading & async | Mentioned in `event-loop.md`, `performance.md`. No recipe. | New page: `platform/threading-and-async.md` |
| Accessibility | Absent | New page: `platform/accessibility.md` |
| macOS specifics | Only notarization in `build-and-ship.md` | New page or section: App menu / Cmd vs Ctrl / native fullscreen / Quit / Retina |
| Windows specifics | Largely absent | DPI manifest / dark title bar / taskbar / MSI signing |
| Linux specifics | Absent | X11 vs Wayland / fractional scaling / `.desktop` / AppImage / Flatpak |
| i18n runtime | Only message catalogs | RTL layout / font fallback for CJK & Arabic / locale detection |
| Auto-update | Absent | Pattern guidance or "use 3rd-party" pointer |
| Crash handling & logging | One paragraph in `debugging.md` | Structured logging + uncaught exception handler + dialog-on-crash |
| Native vs custom dialogs | Absent | When `tkinter.filedialog` vs `ttkbootstrap.MessageDialog` |

**Broken cross-reference** — `docs/platform/build-and-ship.md:128` points to `../capabilities/icons-and-imagery.md`; correct path is `../capabilities/icons/index.md`.

### C. Images and Placeholders (Goal 3)

- 65 image files on disk in `docs/assets/{light,dark}/` (60 PNG + 6 MP4 + favicon + 2 logos).
- 50 references resolve correctly. Only **10 of 77** widget pages have screenshots.
- **3 broken paths** to non-existent `docs/_img/`:
  - `docs/widgets/selection/selectbox.md:13-14`
  - `docs/widgets/inputs/scale.md:12-13`
- **15 widget pages** carry an `IMAGE:` text placeholder (mostly layout, navigation, views, dialogs).
- Screenshot generators exist in `docs_scripts/` (7 scripts: button, checkbutton, radiobutton, dateentry, numericentry, spinnerentry, textentry). No CI integration.

### D. User-Guide Audit

**Empty guide files** (0 bytes) linked from `docs/guides/index.md`:
- `docs/guides/dialogs.md`
- `docs/guides/forms.md`
- `docs/guides/tables-and-lists.md`
- `docs/guides/toolbars.md`

**Duplicate concepts across sections:**
- Icons: `guides/icons.md` + `design-system/icons.md` + `capabilities/icons/icons.md`
- Typography: `guides/typography.md` + `design-system/typography.md`
- Theming: `guides/theming.md` + `design-system/custom-themes.md`
- Layout: `guides/layout.md` + `capabilities/layout/index.md` + `capabilities/layout/containers.md`
- Localization: `guides/localization.md` + `capabilities/localization.md` (this pair is the cleanest split)

Suggested canonical homes:
- **Design System** = the *what* (tokens, names, palette, type scale).
- **Guides** = *how to use it in your app*.
- **Capabilities** = *what the framework does for you*.

**Examples** — mixed Tk-vars + signals usage. The framework prefers signals (`docs/index.md:62-65`); examples should lead with signals and offer Tk-vars as a "compatibility" alternative.

**Canonical import** — `import ttkbootstrap as ttk` per the docstring at `__init__.py:7-13`. Audit examples for drift.

**Widget page templates** — `docs/_template/widget-*-template.md` exist; pages mostly conform. Drift should be caught by a structure linter, not by hand.

### E. Cross-Cutting

- `LIBRARY_STRUCTURE.md` at the repo root duplicates information now living in `docs/platform/project-structure.md` and is already drifting. Should be deleted or folded in.
- No "Migrating from v1" or "Migrating from tkinter" guide. Highest-leverage missing user-guide page given `_DEPRECATED_ALIASES`.
- Capabilities ↔ Platform overlap on signals, virtual events, layout — the boundary is documented but not always observed in the prose.

### F. Platform-Specific Features That Need Surfacing

Each lives in two places under the spec/guide split: in the **docstring** (so the spec renders it) AND in the **user-guide** narrative.

| Feature | Docstring needs | User-guide page |
|---|---|---|
| `Shortcuts` `<Mod>` → Cmd on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere | `Shortcuts` class docstring | `platform/platform-differences.md` (new) |
| Native macOS App menu items (About, Preferences, Quit) | `MenuManager`, `App` | `widgets/application/app.md`, macOS section |
| DPI scaling per OS | `App`, `Image` | `platform/images-and-dpi.md` per-OS subsections |
| Dialogs are not native | each dialog class | `widgets/dialogs/index.md` |
| Window decorations / fullscreen | `App`, `Toplevel` | `platform/windows.md` |
| Toast positioning conventions | `Toast` | `widgets/overlays/toast.md` |
| `PathEntry` separator handling | `PathEntry` | `widgets/inputs/pathentry.md` |
| `ContextMenu` macOS Ctrl-click | `ContextMenu` | `widgets/actions/contextmenu.md` |

---

## Plan

Phased by dependency and risk. Phase 1 is trivial cleanup. Phase 2 sets up the spec discipline that everything else depends on. Phases 3–6 are larger content work.

Status legend: `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` deferred.

### Phase 1 — One-line fixes (low risk, high signal)

- [x] **1A.** Removed duplicate `SideNav` entry in `zensical.toml` and moved `SideNavItem`/`Group`/`Header`/`Separator` to alphabetical position next to canonical `SideNav`.
- [x] **1B.** Fixed broken link in `docs/platform/build-and-ship.md:128` (now `../capabilities/icons/index.md`, label updated to "Icons & Images").
- [x] **1C.** Replaced `_img/` paths in `docs/widgets/selection/selectbox.md` (2 occurrences) and `docs/widgets/inputs/scale.md` with the canonical HTML-comment `IMAGE:` placeholder used by other widget pages.
- [x] **1D.** Renamed `NavigationViewItem/Group/Header/Separator.md` → `SideNavItem/Group/Header/Separator.md` (via `git mv`, history preserved). Updated `zensical.toml` paths. `NavigationView.md` (the deprecation redirect) left in place; it's not in nav and Phase 7B will systematize deprecated names.
- [-] **1E.** Deferred. `LIBRARY_STRUCTURE.md` is **not** a duplicate of `docs/platform/project-structure.md` — it's a contributor/AI-context map of `src/ttkbootstrap/` internals (added in PR #974), while project-structure.md is for *user* apps. Leaving as-is for now; revisit later.

### Phase 2 — Make the spec model durable

This is the foundation for Goal 1.

- [x] **2A.** Wired `ruff` `D` rules with Google convention in `pyproject.toml` ([tool.ruff] section). Internal directories blanket-ignored via `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]`; currently-dirty public-surface files are listed individually so each entry can be removed once that file's docstrings are brought to spec. `ruff check src/ttkbootstrap` passes today. The 13 priority files cleaned in 2D form the enforced baseline.
- [x] **2B.** Docstring template defined below ("Docstring template" section). Anchored on the existing local style: class docstring carries narrative (purpose, when to use) and `Examples:`; `__init__` docstring carries `Args:` and per-parameter details. mkdocstrings renders both (`merge_init_into_class` is unset → default False), so location follows convention; only content matters. `BaseDataSource` (`src/ttkbootstrap/datasource/base.py:27-53`) is one reference; `Form` (`form.py:111-155`) and `Button.__init__` (`button.py:56-85`) are also strong examples of the local style.
- [-] **2C/2D.** Deferred to a session with a running Tk display for rendered review. All public-surface files now pass `ruff check --select D` with zero suppressions (per-file-ignores list cleared 2026-04-29). Content quality (thin narratives, missing Attributes/Args depth) for the 20 priority symbols remains to be verified against the rendered output.
  - Priority symbols: `App`, `AppShell`, `Toplevel`, `Window`, `Button`, `Label`, `Frame`, `GridFrame`, `PackFrame`, `TextEntry`, `NumericEntry`, `DateEntry`, `Combobox`, `OptionMenu`, `SelectBox`, `TableView`, `TreeView`, `Form`, `Style`, `Bootstyle`, `MessageDialog`, `BaseDataSource`

### Phase 3 — Reference-spec gap close

- [-] **3A.** Skipped per scope decision: Tk re-exports (`Tk`, `Menu`, `Text`, `Canvas`, `TkFrame`, `Variable`, `StringVar`, `IntVar`, `BooleanVar`, `DoubleVar`, `PhotoImage`) point at stdlib classes. Their canonical docs are at python.org; a redundant page in our reference is editorial work for little value. Re-visit if user need surfaces.
- [x] **3B.** Reconciled: only `MenuBar` was actually missing. (`SideNavItem/Group/Header/Separator` existed under their old `NavigationView*` names; renamed in Phase 1D. `Accordion`, `Badge`, `CheckToggle`, `RadioToggle` already had pages — survey notes were over-broad.) Created `docs/reference/widgets/MenuBar.md`.
- [x] **3C.** Created `docs/reference/app/Shortcut.md` and `docs/reference/app/get_shortcuts.md`. Also added the existing `Shortcuts.md` to nav (it had a file but no nav entry). `Window` resolved by mention in `App` class docstring (Phase 2D); separate page deferred — alias inheriting App's spec is sufficient.
- [-] **3D.** Decision (confirmed by user 2026-04-29): leave `TK_WIDGETS` / `TTK_WIDGETS` as public constants for `isinstance()` use, but skip a dedicated reference page. Hand-writing prose for two tuples-of-classes is editorial; mkdocstrings doesn't autodoc them well; the canonical view of their composition is in `src/ttkbootstrap/widgets/__init__.py`.
- [x] **3E.** Resolved duplicate URLs in `reference/widgets/`. Deleted 16 files via `git rm` (preserves history): `App.md`, `AppShell.md`, `Toplevel.md`, `Style.md`, and 12 dialog pages. All were byte-identical to their canonical home in `reference/app/`, `reference/style/`, or `reference/dialogs/` (except `widgets/AppShell.md` which was a redirect-style page with no inbound links, and `widgets/App.md` which was a thinner version of the canonical). No nav entries pointed at any of them; ruff still passes.
- [x] **3F.** No change needed. `reference/capabilities/` pages already follow the spec model — each renders the relevant mixin via `::: ttkbootstrap.core.capabilities.X.YMixin`. They serve users browsing "what can my widget do?" The brief intro paragraph on each page is mechanical (not editorial). Originally flagged for review; no action required.
- [x] **3G.** Done. `docs/reference/core/app.md` and `docs/reference/core/style.md` were both 0-byte stubs with no nav reference. Deleted via `git rm`; empty `docs/reference/core/` directory removed.
- [x] **3H.** Audited and patched `reference/<section>/index.md` pages: `app/index.md` gained `Shortcut` and `get_shortcuts` entries (the latter previously linked to `Shortcuts.md` instead of its own page); `style/index.md` and `reference/index.md` had stale "bootstyle" framing in narrative — replaced with the canonical token vocabulary (`accent`, `variant`, `surface`, etc.); `i18n/index.md` referenced a non-existent "Platform → Localization" page — corrected to "Guides → Localization."

### Phase 4 — Platform section completion (Goal 2)

- [x] **4A.** New page: `platform/threading-and-async.md`. Covers worker thread + `Queue` pattern, `after_idle`, `after_repeat`, and `asyncio` integration trade-offs. Added to nav under Operations.
- [x] **4B.** New page: `platform/platform-differences.md`. Single matrix-style page covering macOS / Windows / Linux differences (Mod key, ContextMenu trigger and backend, Toast position, App quit behavior, window_style, system appearance sync, state directory, native vs themed dialogs). Added to nav.
- [x] **4C.** New page: `platform/accessibility.md`. Keyboard navigation, tab order, focus rings (visual_focus system), contrast guidance, honest screen reader status per OS, practical checklist. Added to nav.
- [x] **4D.** Expanded `platform/images-and-dpi.md` with per-OS sections: macOS Retina (OS-handled, @1x assets), Windows DPI manifest (auto via hdpi=True, Image utility for sizing), Linux X11 fractional scaling (explicit scaling param), Wayland note, scaling summary table, image caching and common pitfalls.
- [x] **4E.** Added "Shipping to Windows" and "Shipping to Linux" sections to `platform/build-and-ship.md`, mirroring the existing macOS pattern: describe what `ttkb build` produces locally, list the additional steps needed for distribution, explain why ttkbootstrap doesn't wrap them, then delegate. Windows: Authenticode signing + MSI via Briefcase. Linux: AppImage / `.deb` via Briefcase, Flatpak via `flatpak-builder` upstream. Resolves open question 4.
- [x] **4F.** Expanded `platform/debugging.md` with structured logging setup, `report_callback_exception` override, `sys.excepthook`, crash dialog pattern with MessageBox, background-thread caveat, widget tree dump, geometry timing recipe.
- [x] **4G.** Added "Native vs custom dialogs" section to `docs/widgets/dialogs/index.md` explaining that ttkbootstrap dialogs are themed Tk windows (not OS-native) and directing users to `tkinter.filedialog` / `tkinter.colorchooser` for native behavior.

### Phase 5 — User-guide cleanup

- [x] **5A.** Filled the four empty guides:
  - `docs/guides/dialogs.md` — choosing a dialog, `.show()`/`.result` pattern, MessageBox/QueryBox facades, specialized pickers, FormDialog, custom Dialog subclassing.
  - `docs/guides/forms.md` — inferred vs. explicit layout, FieldItem/GroupItem/TabsItem grammar, editor types, validation rules, footer buttons, FormDialog handoff.
  - `docs/guides/tables-and-lists.md` — TableView/ListView/TreeView selection matrix, CRUD, filtering/sorting/grouping, custom row factories, DataSource integration.
  - `docs/guides/toolbars.md` — `add_button`/`label`/`separator`/`spacer`/`widget`, spacer-based layout, density, custom titlebars via window controls, AppShell integration.
- [x] **5B.** Deduplicated icon documentation. `capabilities/icons/icons.md` rewritten as pure mechanics (provider resolution, state integration, theme-driven coloring, DPI scaling, caching). `design-system/icons.md` unchanged (already correct "what" pointer). `guides/icons.md` unchanged as canonical "how" page; added Capabilities link to Related resources.
- [x] **5C.** Deduplicated typography documentation. `design-system/typography.md` updated with the complete 13-token table and full modifier vocabulary (was stale with 4 generic tokens). `guides/typography.md` unchanged as canonical "how" page (it already linked to design-system).
- [x] **5D.** Deduplicated theming documentation. `design-system/custom-themes.md` expanded with the theme vocabulary (properties table, shades/spectrum explanation, semantic token table, built-in themes list) — was nearly empty. `guides/theming.md` unchanged as canonical "how" page; added Design System link to its Next Steps section.
- [x] **5E.** Deduplicated layout/spacing documentation. `capabilities/layout/containers.md` trimmed of "when to use PackFrame vs GridFrame" guide content (was duplicating guides/layout.md); replaced with a pointer to the guide. `guides/layout.md` added link to Capabilities: Layout in Next steps. `guides/spacing-and-alignment.md` and `capabilities/layout/spacing.md` are non-overlapping (different levels of abstraction).
- [-] **5F.** Deferred. Library will be rebranded; migration story will be handled as part of that effort rather than as a standalone guide.
- [x] **5G.** Updated widget-page examples to lead with signals. Reordered signal-before-textvariable in: `entry.md`, `spinbox.md`, `combobox.md`, `optionmenu.md`. Expanded `selectbox.md` "Binding" section with a `textsignal=` example (was just a tip pointing at textvariable). `calendar.md` already correctly described (no textvariable support). Tk-variable forms labeled "(compatibility)" throughout.
- [x] **5H.** Standardize the canonical import (`import ttkbootstrap as ttk`) across all examples in guides and widgets. Fixed `scrollbar.md`, `menubutton.md`, and two examples in `localization.md` that used non-existent `set_locale`/`get_locale` functions (replaced with `MessageCatalog.locale()`). All remaining `from ttkbootstrap import X` patterns are intentional named imports (localization helpers `L`, `LV`, `MessageCatalog`, `IntlFormatter`; theming utilities; `Font`).
- [x] **5I.** Added `tools/check_doc_structure.py` — maps 9 widget categories to their templates, checks every .md for required H2s, reports missing sections. Exit 0/1 for CI. Run: `python tools/check_doc_structure.py [--category NAME]`.

### Phase 6 — Images & screenshot pipeline (Goal 3)

- [x] **6A.** Image policy locked 2026-04-29: every widget page that renders something visible has a light + dark screenshot pair. "Visible" = the widget is the subject of the page (not abstract bases or section indices). Pages whose appearance is trivially derivable from a sibling can reuse with a one-line note. Light/dark map to the canonical `docs-light` / `docs-dark` themes (registered at `src/ttkbootstrap/runtime/app.py:302-303`).
- [x] **6B.** Done.
  - Manifest at `docs_scripts/screenshots.toml` (26 entries: button × 7, checkbutton × 5, radiobutton × 2, textentry × 3, dateentry × 3, numericentry × 3, spinnerentry × 3); runner at `docs_scripts/render.py`; per-widget factories under `docs_scripts/shots/<widget>.py`.
  - Each `[[shots]]` entry = one slug × {light, dark} → `docs/assets/<theme>/<slug>.png`. Themes map `light`/`dark` to canonical `docs-light`/`docs-dark`. Opt-out via `themes = ["light"]`.
  - Factory contract: `def factory(parent: Widget) -> Optional[Callable]`. `parent` is a renderer-supplied padded `Frame`; the optional return value is a `finalize` hook the renderer invokes right before grab so visual state flags (`state(["focus"])`, `state(["hover"])`) survive WM focus events. Use `widget.focus_set()` for true keyboard focus when a focus ring is desired.
  - Capture flow per shot: `App(theme=…, hdpi=False)` → build via factory → `geometry("+200+200")` → `deiconify()` → `lift()` → `attributes("-topmost", True)` → 500 ms `after()` → run `finalize` → `update()` → `ImageGrab.grab(bbox=capture_frame.winfo_root*)` → save.
  - Architecture decisions and rationale: NOT `override_redirect=True` (kills WM focus event propagation, flattens focus/hover visuals); NOT `focus_force()` (steals focus from widgets we manually flagged); ONE subprocess per `(slug, theme)` via internal `--_render-one` flag (Tk multi-instance state leaks named fonts and style registrations across `App.destroy()`/recreate). Single-process runs fail on the 2nd shot.
  - Validation: ran all 7 button shots (light + 1 dark spot-check) and one shot per other widget type (checkbutton, radiobutton, textentry, dateentry, numericentry, spinnerentry) with clean output, correct theme, no titlebar/bleed-through, state flags applied (verified by reading `widget.state()` at capture time).
  - Limitation: solid primary `state(["focus"])` produces no visible focus ring in current `docs-light` theme (style builder defines distinct focus images in `style/builders/button.py:69-73`, but the docs-light theme's images don't visually differentiate). State mechanism in renderer is correct; visual is a v2 theme behavior to investigate separately.
  - Deferred until after 6E parity sweep: deletion of original `docs_scripts/widget*.py` and `widgets_*.py` (kept side-by-side until generated assets are confirmed equivalent), and a `widgets-dateentry-popup.png` factory that programmatically opens the calendar dropdown.
- [x] **6C.** Done. `ttkb screenshots` registered in `src/ttkbootstrap/cli/screenshots.py` as a thin wrapper over `python -m docs_scripts.render` with `--slug`, `--page`, `--theme` passthrough. Walks up from cwd to find `docs_scripts/screenshots.toml`; errors out cleanly when run outside a source checkout.
- [x] **6D.** Done. `tools/check_doc_images.py` scans `docs/widgets/**/*.md`, resolves every Markdown image reference relative to its file, and verifies the on-disk asset exists. Strips `#fragment` and `?query` (so `#only-light` references resolve correctly) and skips `http(s)://` / `data:` URLs. Surfaces `IMAGE: ...` placeholders separately as INFO; `--strict-placeholders` upgrades them to failures. First run flagged 2 pre-existing broken refs in `docs/widgets/inputs/scrolledtext.md` (now converted to placeholders for 6E pickup) and reports 19 outstanding `IMAGE:` placeholders for 6E to clear.
- [x] **6E.** In-frame shots done across 13 batches (2026-04-29 → 2026-04-30). Every widget page that renders inline content has a light + dark pair: actions (button, buttongroup, menubutton, dropdownbutton), application (app, appshell, toplevel), data-display (label, badge, progressbar, floodgauge, meter, listview, tableview, treeview), forms (form), inputs (all 10), layout (all 12), navigation (tabs, toolbar, sidenav), primitives (all 5), selection (all except selectbox), views (all 3). 4 popup placeholders intentionally remain in the manifest (`datedialog`, `messagebox`, `selectbox` × 2) and roll forward to 6F. **Caveat:** the macOS pass landed the manifest, factories, and figure blocks, but per user direction the canonical PNGs will be re-rendered on Windows — a single `python -m docs_scripts.render` pass on a Windows host overwrites every asset.
- [ ] **6F.** Two distinct asset classes need capture tooling beyond the in-frame model:
  - **Popup-shape widgets** (overlay the main window): `ContextMenu`, `SelectBox` open state, and all 11 dialog pages (`Dialog`, `MessageBox`, `MessageDialog`, `ColorChooser`, `ColorDropper`, `DateDialog`, `FontDialog`, `FilterDialog`, `FormDialog`, `QueryBox`, `QueryDialog`). Needs a renderer mode that captures a Toplevel bbox after the popup is realized but before any modal `grab_set` blocks the parent loop. The 4 `IMAGE:` placeholders remaining in the manifest belong to this group.
  - **Animated widgets** (need MP4 / GIF): `Toast`, `Tooltip`, `Accordion` (collapse animation), `Expander`, `PageStack` transitions, `FloodGauge`, `Meter`. Needs a display + recording tool (e.g. `ffmpeg` screen capture or `xvfb-run` on Linux CI).

### Phase 7 — Polish

- [x] **7A.** Added platform admonitions to user-guide pages:
  - `widgets/actions/contextmenu.md` — fixed quick start to use portable `target=app` trigger (was using `<Button-3>` directly, which misses macOS Ctrl+click); added cross-platform right-click note and macOS native NSMenu backend note.
  - `widgets/overlays/toast.md` — added position-by-platform note (bottom-right on macOS/Windows, top-right on Linux X11).
  - `widgets/application/app.md` — added macOS quit behavior note (close hides, Cmd+Q quits; how to restore classic destroy-on-close).
  - `guides/typography.md` — upgraded inline platform-fonts sentence to a `!!! note` admonition.
- [x] **7B.** Created `docs/reference/deprecated.md` listing all 12 aliases from `_DEPRECATED_ALIASES` with replacement names and migration snippet. Added to nav in `zensical.toml` and `reference/index.md`.
- [x] **7C.** Final sweep: searched "TODO/TBD/coming soon" — one hit in deprecated.md (stale migration guide link) removed. Fixed 11 broken internal capability links across 8 widget/guide files (icons-and-imagery → icons/index.md, signals.md → signals/index.md, callbacks.md → signals/callbacks.md, virtual-events.md → signals/virtual-events.md). Rendered rebuild deferred (requires display).

### Phase 8 — Follow-ups surfaced during 6E

These were discovered while authoring screenshot factories — the factories couldn't run the documented snippets verbatim, which exposed live drift between the docs and the implementation. Each item is a concrete docs-or-code fix.

- [x] **8A. `dropdownbutton.md` API drift.** Fixed in drift sweep (Pass 1, 2026-04-30). All ContextMenuItem calls in `dropdownbutton.md` now use `type=` as first positional; separator uses `ContextMenuItem("separator")`; per-item `accent=` removed; `DropdownButton(command=)` removed (not implemented). Sibling pages `contextmenu.md` and `menubutton.md` had no raw ContextMenuItem calls to fix.
- [ ] **8B. ListView `badge` field is documented but not dispatched.** `ListItem` (`widgets/composites/list/listitem.py:34-44`) lists `badge` as a recognized field, but `update_data` (`listitem.py:725-734`) only dispatches `title`/`text`/`caption`/`icon` — `badge` is silently dropped. Either add `"badge": self._update_badge` to that mapping, or remove the field from the docstring. Code fix is preferable since `_update_badge` (`listitem.py:428-453`) is fully implemented.
- [ ] **8C. Phase 2C/2D rendered review.** Originally deferred to a session with a running Tk display. Now that `python -m docs_scripts.render` works end-to-end, the same display can drive `zensical serve -o` for the 22 priority symbols listed in the per-symbol tracker. Goal: verify the rendered output of `App`, `AppShell`, `Form`, `TableView`, `MessageDialog`, `BaseDataSource`, etc. matches the spec model in practice (no orphan `Examples:`, no broken cross-links, `Attributes:` and `Args:` both showing).

### Phase 9 — Snippet validation tooling and Pass 1 drift (2026-04-30)

- [x] **9A. Snippet extraction tool.** `tools/check_doc_snippets.py` — walks `docs/**/*.md`, extracts every fenced `\`\`\`python` block, runs `compile()` on all of them (syntax check, no display needed), and executes *self-contained* snippets (those that create `ttk.App(` or `ttk.AppShell(`) in fresh subprocesses with mainloop/show calls patched out. Exit 0 = clean. Run: `python tools/check_doc_snippets.py` (compile only) or `python tools/check_doc_snippets.py --run` (full execution, requires display).
- [x] **9B. Pass 1 drift sweep.** Tool surfaced 56 runtime failures across 22 files. All fixed and committed. Issues: wrong class names (`ttk.Tooltip`→`ToolTip`, `ttk.Sizegrip`→`SizeGrip`, `ttk.ColorDropper`→`ColorDropperDialog`, `ttk.ListView` not exported), wrong constructor kwargs (`ContextMenuItem` missing `type=`, dialog pages using `message=`/`fields=`/`filters=`/`initial=` that don't exist), wrong option names (`signal=`→`textsignal=`, `values=`→`options=` for OptionMenu, `App(locale=...)`→`App(settings={"locale":...})`), invalid theme names (`cosmo-light`→`cosmo`, `cosmo-dark`→`darkly`), `Image.open(size=)` doesn't exist (rewritten to use asset variants), and several syntactic doc placeholders (`...` in dict, `return` at module level in conceptual snippets). 833 snippets in 107 files now pass compile + runtime checks with 0 failures.
- [ ] **9C. `OptionMenu(command=)` and `DropdownButton(command=)` not implemented.** Both have `command` in their TypedDicts and docstrings but don't pop it before calling `super().__init__()`, so it flows through to Tk as `-command` which fails. Docs currently work around this using `bind("<<Change>>", ...)`. Real fix: pop `command` in `__init__` and wire it to the `<<Change>>` event. Low risk — one-line fix in each widget.
- [ ] **9D. `ListView` not in public API.** `ttk.ListView` returns False from `hasattr`. The class exists at `ttkbootstrap.widgets.composites.list.listview.ListView` but is not exported through `__init__.py` or any `api/*.py` module. Either add to exports or document that users should import from the internal path.

## Docstring Template

Local convention: class docstring carries narrative + examples; `__init__` docstring carries `Args:`. mkdocstrings (per `zensical.toml:399-408`) renders both — `merge_init_into_class` is unset, so each appears as its own section on the rendered page. **Don't relocate existing content; fill the gaps.**

### Class docstring

Spec, not user guide. Describe what the class **is** and what it **does** — mechanics, not editorial. Don't write "when to use it," "best practices," or "how it compares to X." Those belong on the user-guide page (`docs/widgets/...`).

```
"""<One-line summary ending with a period.>

<1–2 short paragraphs describing what the class is and how it behaves
mechanically.> No advice, no comparisons, no "when to use." If users
need to choose between this and a sibling class, that's a user-guide
question.

Attributes:
    <name> (<type>): <one-line description>.
    ...

Notes:
    <Behavioral facts not covered above: threading, lifecycle, ordering,
    side effects, cache behavior, etc. Anything that's part of the
    contract.> Only include if there's something to say.

Platform:
    On macOS, ...
    On Windows, ...
    <Only if behavior differs by platform.>

Deprecated:
    Since 2.0. Use `<replacement>` instead. Will be removed in 3.0.
    <Only if applicable.>
"""
```

Examples are **off by default**. The user guide owns examples and screenshots. Add an `Examples:` section to a docstring **only** when one of the following is true:

- The call shape is non-obvious from the signature (decorator, context manager, abstract subclassing pattern, callback signature, unusual nested data structure).
- An ambiguity in the signature (e.g. polymorphic argument types) is best resolved by showing one line of code.

"Construct it and pack it" is not a reason to add an example. Most widget classes will not have `Examples:` blocks.

### `__init__` docstring

```
"""<One-line summary of construction.>

Args:
    <name> (<type>): <description>. Mention defaults in prose, not in the type.
    ...

Other Parameters:
    <kw> (<type>): <description>.
    ...
        (Use Other Parameters for `**kwargs` items expanded from a TypedDict.)

Raises:
    <ExceptionType>: <when it's raised>.
"""
```

### Rules

- **Spec, not user guide.** Describe mechanics. No editorial language: no "best to use when…", no comparisons to sibling classes, no recommendations, no rationale.
- **Plain Markdown only.** No reST roles or directives (`:param:`, `:func:`, `.. note::`).
- **Google style.** mkdocstrings is configured for it (`zensical.toml:400`).
- **Code fences must specify a language** (`python`, `bash`, etc.).
- **Examples must be runnable as-shown** with `import ttkbootstrap as ttk`.
- **One canonical import** in examples: `import ttkbootstrap as ttk`.
- **Don't duplicate Args between class and `__init__`.** Args go on `__init__`.
- **Keep `Attributes:` on the class**, not on `__init__`.
- **Admonitions are allowed but optional.** The `admonition` extension is enabled (`zensical.toml:418`), so `!!! note "Events"` and similar render correctly. Existing docstrings use this convention for `Events:` blocks. Plain prose sections (`Notes:`, `Platform:`) are equally fine — pick one style per docstring and stay consistent with the surrounding file.
- **Don't link to user-guide pages from docstrings.** The spec is self-contained. Cross-links live on the reference page or the user-guide page itself, not inside the source.
- **Don't reference `bootstyle` in descriptive prose.** The `bootstyle` parameter is deprecated (see `_DEPRECATED_ALIASES` and inline DEPRECATED markers in `*Kwargs` TypedDicts). In class-level narrative, describe styling via the canonical tokens — `accent`, `variant`, `density`, `surface`, `show_border`, etc. — typically as "theme-aware styling" or by naming the tokens directly. The `bootstyle` parameter itself can still be marked DEPRECATED in `Other Parameters:` for users who haven't migrated.

## Open Questions

All resolved as of 2026-04-30. Kept here as a record of what was actually decided versus what was deferred without resolution.

1. ~~**`docs/reference/capabilities/` direction (Phase 3F).** Spec for mixins, or move to user-guide?~~ Resolved 2026-04-29: kept as spec. Each page renders the relevant mixin via `::: ...YMixin`; the brief intro is mechanical, not editorial. No move.
2. ~~**`reference/widgets/` deprecated-alias files (Phase 1D vs 3E).** Rename to canonical, or delete entirely?~~ Resolved 2026-04-29: deleted the 16 duplicate files via `git rm` (Phase 3E); a single canonical `docs/reference/deprecated.md` replaces them (Phase 7B).
3. ~~**`TK_WIDGETS` / `TTK_WIDGETS` (Phase 3D).** Public API or internal?~~ Resolved 2026-04-29: left public (intended for `isinstance()` use) but no dedicated reference page. Same call applies to the Tk re-exports — canonical docs are at python.org.
4. ~~**Per-OS packaging guidance scope (Phase 4E).** First-party recipes, or "use Briefcase / use PyInstaller" pointers?~~ Resolved 2026-04-29: delegation pointers, mirroring the existing macOS pattern. `ttkb build` stays scoped to local PyInstaller bundling; signing/installers/sandboxed formats delegate to Briefcase (Windows MSI, Linux AppImage/.deb) and `flatpak-builder` (Flatpak).
5. ~~**Image policy strictness (Phase 6A).** Mandatory for every widget, or judgment call per page?~~ Resolved 2026-04-29: mandatory pair. Every widget page that renders something visible gets a light + dark pair using the canonical `docs-light` / `docs-dark` themes; opt-out (`themes = ["light"]`) only for genuinely theme-agnostic assets.
6. ~~**`Tabs` and `TabView` API status.** Neither was in `_MODULE_EXPORTS`.~~ Resolved 2026-04-29: per user direction, both promoted to public exports for consistency with peer layout widgets (`PageStack`, `Notebook`, `SideNav`, `Toolbar`).

## Decisions Log

Date — Decision — Rationale.

- 2026-04-29 — Adopted user-guide vs API-spec split as the documentation model. Reference pages stay bare `::: module.Class`; narrative goes in user guide. Spec quality = docstring quality. CI lint enforces it.
- 2026-04-29 — `LIBRARY_STRUCTURE.md` reframed: not a duplicate, serves contributors/AI context. Final disposition pending user decision (1E).
- 2026-04-29 — Image placeholder convention is the HTML-comment block (`<!-- IMAGE: ... -->`) used in layout/navigation widget pages. Visible quote-block placeholders replaced.
- 2026-04-29 — Docstring location convention: class docstring carries narrative + `Attributes:` + `Examples:`; `__init__` carries `Args:`. Both render via mkdocstrings (`merge_init_into_class` unset). Don't relocate existing content; fill gaps in the class docstring.
- 2026-04-29 — Phase 2 sequencing changed: 2B → 2D (in batches) → 2A. Tooling (2A) added at the end so CI doesn't go red on day 1.
- 2026-04-29 — Docstring template tightened: spec, not user guide. No "when to use," no comparisons, no editorial. Mechanics + minimal examples. User-guide content stays in `docs/widgets/...`, `docs/guides/...`.
- 2026-04-29 — Examples in docstrings made off-by-default. Only included when the call shape is non-obvious or signature ambiguity needs a one-liner to resolve. The user guide owns examples and screenshots.
- 2026-04-29 — `bootstyle` is deprecated and should not appear in descriptive prose. Class narratives describe styling via the canonical tokens (`accent`, `variant`, etc.). The deprecated `bootstyle` parameter itself is still marked DEPRECATED in argument docs for users who haven't migrated.
- 2026-04-29 — Phase 2A landed. `ruff` `D` rules with Google convention enforced via `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`. Currently-dirty public-surface files use per-file ignores; each entry is removed when that file's docstrings conform. Internal directories (`builders/`, `mixins/`, `internal/`, `parts/`, `capabilities/`, `cli/`, `assets/`) are blanket-ignored. New files in non-ignored directories are linted from day 1.
- 2026-04-29 — `Tabs` and `TabView` promoted to public API exports per user direction (consistent with peer layout widgets `PageStack`, `Notebook`, `SideNav`, `Toolbar`). Added to `api/widgets.py` and `__init__.py` `_MODULE_EXPORTS` + TYPE_CHECKING block.
- 2026-04-29 — `TK_WIDGETS` / `TTK_WIDGETS` left public but with no dedicated reference page. Same call applies to Tk re-exports (`Tk`, `Variable`, `StringVar`, etc.) — canonical Python docs already cover them; a redundant page in our reference is editorial work for little value.
- 2026-04-29 — Phase 6A image policy is mandatory pair: every widget page that renders something visible has a light + dark screenshot. Themes are the canonical `docs-light` / `docs-dark` (already platform defaults). Opt-out (`themes = ["light"]`) only for genuinely theme-agnostic assets.
- 2026-04-29 — Phase 6B render architecture: manifest-driven `docs_scripts/render.py` with per-widget factory modules. One subprocess per (slug × theme) for clean Tk lifecycle isolation; `App(override_redirect=True)` to drop the titlebar from the bbox; brief mainloop with a 500 ms `after()` capture for reliable Cocoa compositing. Capture target is a renderer-supplied padded `parent` Frame so the bbox never spills into adjacent windows.
- 2026-04-30 — Phase 6E in-frame screenshots complete (13 batches). Popup-shape widgets (ContextMenu, SelectBox open state, all dialogs) and animated widgets (Toast, Tooltip, Accordion, Expander, PageStack, FloodGauge, Meter) explicitly rolled into 6F since both need capture tooling beyond the in-frame model. The macOS pass landed manifest + factories + figure blocks; canonical PNGs will be re-rendered on Windows in a single `render` invocation.
- 2026-04-30 — App and Toplevel get representative interior shots even though they're window classes. The renderer captures the interior `capture_frame` — which is exactly what these widgets host — so a "Hello world" / settings-dialog composition is the honest visual, not a misleading mock of OS chrome.
- 2026-04-30 — Phase 8 created to track docs-vs-implementation drift discovered while authoring screenshot factories. Authoring runnable factories proved more effective than reading docs at surfacing API drift, since the factory has to actually execute. Future docs work should consider similar "load-bearing example" passes.

## Per-Symbol Docstring Status (Phase 2C/2D tracker)

Surveyed 2026-04-29. "Gap" describes what's missing relative to the template; the existing `__init__` Args layout is the local convention and is preserved.

Under the tightened template, **no `Examples:`** is the default. Most rows now reduce to: confirm class narrative is mechanical (not editorial), confirm `Args:` is complete, confirm `Attributes:` covers public attributes.

| `Style` | `style/style.py` | multi-section | yes | none — verified on-spec | [x] |
| `MessageDialog` | `dialogs/message.py` | multi-section | yes | done — fixed doubled summary, removed editorial advice, mentioned `show()`/`.result` call shape, updated `bootstyle` references in Args | [x] |
