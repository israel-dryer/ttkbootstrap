## Framework integration

### Signals & events

Widgets participate in ttkbootstrap’s reactive model.

- **Signals** represent a widget’s **value/state** and are built on **Tk variables** with a modern subscription API.

- **Events** (including virtual events) represent **interactions and moments** (click, commit, focus, selection changed).

Signals and events are complementary: use signals for state flow and composition, and use events when you need
interaction-level integration.

### Design system

Widgets are styled through ttkbootstrap’s design system using:

- semantic colors via `bootstyle` (e.g., `primary`, `success`, `danger`)

- variants (e.g., `outline`, `link`, `ghost` where supported)

- consistent state visuals across themes

### Layout properties

Widgets support ttkbootstrap layout conveniences (when available) so they compose cleanly in modern layouts.

### Localization

Text labels can be localized in localized applications.
