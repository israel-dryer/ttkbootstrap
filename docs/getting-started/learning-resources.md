# Learning Resources

This page collects tutorials, examples, and reference material to help you deepen your understanding of ttkbootstrap v2
and the design system it provides.

Whether you prefer step-by-step guides, real application examples, or exploratory demos, these resources are intended to
support different learning styles and stages of adoption.

## Tutorials

Tutorials walk through complete scenarios and explain *why* patterns are used, not just *how* they are implemented.

Common topics include:

- **Building form-driven interfaces**  
  Covers inputs, validation-friendly layouts, PageStack navigation, and form-based dialogs.

- **Feedback and dialog patterns**  
  Explores tooltips, toasts, dialog primitives, and how feedback layers over responsive layouts.

- **Theming and appearance**  
  Explains semantic bootstyle tokens, runtime theme switching, and extending themes with custom palettes.

Tutorials are ideal when you want structured guidance through a specific problem space.

## Example Applications

Example applications demonstrate how components work together in realistic contexts.

Examples typically showcase:

- **Minimal UI kits**  
  Small applications combining common inputs and controls using consistent styling.

- **Data-driven dashboards**  
  Applications that use tables, indicators, meters, and signals to present live or structured data.

- **Dialog playgrounds**  
  Interactive samples that demonstrate dialog types, forms, and contextual menus.

Examples are best when you want to explore working code and adapt patterns to your own projects.

## Videos & Demos

Video content provides a more visual, conversational way to learn.

This may include:

- short walkthroughs covering installation, theming, and layout,
- demonstrations of packaging and distribution workflows,
- community sessions exploring advanced patterns and design decisions.

Videos complement the written documentation but are not required to use the framework effectively.

## Reference Material

In addition to tutorials and examples, the documentation itself serves as a primary reference:

- **Widgets**  
  The widget catalog organizes controls by purpose and demonstrates consistent styling and behavior.

- **Design System**  
  Documents layout, color, typography, iconography, theming, variants, and localization.

- **Guides**  
  Focus on application-level patterns such as configuration, signals, events, dialogs, and packaging.

These sections are designed to be read selectively as questions arise.

## Staying Current

ttkbootstrap continues to evolve.

To stay up to date:

- check the **Showcase** for new templates and community projects,
- follow repository discussions for announcements and release notes,
- contribute documentation, examples, or templates if you find gaps.

Community participation helps keep the ecosystem useful and relevant.

## Summary

Learning ttkbootstrap v2 is not about memorizing APIs.

By combining tutorials, examples, and design-focused documentation, you can build a strong mental model of how
applications are structured—then apply that understanding confidently to your own projects.
