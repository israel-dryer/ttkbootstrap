# Project Templates

ttkbootstrap v2 includes a set of **starter project templates** designed to help you begin building applications with a
solid structure from day one.

Each template demonstrates:

- recommended application structure,
- container-driven layout,
- consistent use of bootstyle tokens,
- theme-aware behavior,
- and common real-world patterns.

Templates are not meant to lock you in—they are meant to give you a **strong starting point** without reinventing the
basics.

---

## Why Use a Template?

Starting from a template helps you:

- avoid early architectural mistakes,
- see how design concepts translate into real code,
- understand how widgets, layout, and theming work together,
- move faster from idea to working application.

You can treat templates as:

- a learning tool,
- a reference implementation,
- or the foundation of a production project.

## Template Catalog

### Minimal App

A single-window starter focused on fundamentals.

Demonstrates:

- initializing the application shell,
- applying a theme,
- basic container layout,
- a recommended folder structure.

Ideal for experimentation, prototypes, or small utilities.

---

### Navigation App

A multi-view application showcasing structured navigation.

Demonstrates:

- `PageStack`-based navigation,
- contextual menus,
- toolbars and dashboards,
- navigation that adapts cleanly to theme changes.

Useful for applications with multiple screens or workflows.

---

### Themed App

A template focused on appearance and customization.

Demonstrates:

- multiple theme definitions,
- centralized palette management,
- runtime theme switching,
- consistent use of semantic color and typography tokens.

Useful for applications that require strong branding or user-selectable themes.

---

### Form & Data App

A template centered on data entry and presentation.

Demonstrates:

- form composition,
- dialog-based data entry,
- validation-friendly inputs,
- live data display using tables and indicators.

Useful for tools that manage structured data or workflows.

---

### Localized App

A template designed for internationalized applications.

Demonstrates:

- message catalogs,
- translated labels and messages,
- locale-aware formatting,
- runtime language switching.

Useful for applications intended for global or multilingual users.

---

## Getting Started with a Template

A typical workflow looks like this:

1. Copy or generate a template as your starting point.
2. Install dependencies and run the application to verify setup.
3. Replace example views and logic with your own functionality.
4. Keep the layout structure, design tokens, and patterns intact.
5. Customize themes, localization assets, and widgets as needed.

Templates are intentionally well-documented to help you understand *why* things are structured the way they are.

---

## When to Move Beyond Templates

As your application grows, you may:

- reorganize modules,
- extract shared components,
- introduce additional views or dialogs.

The patterns shown in the templates are meant to scale and adapt—not restrict you.

---

## Where to Go Next

After exploring templates, you can:

- build your own **First Application** from scratch,
- dive deeper into **Guides** for specific patterns,
- explore the **Widget Catalog** to expand functionality,
- customize appearance using the **Design System**.

Templates help you start strong, but the framework is flexible enough to grow with you.

---

## Summary

Project templates provide practical, well-structured starting points that reflect how ttkbootstrap is designed to be
used.

By beginning with a template, you gain clarity, consistency, and momentum—without sacrificing control.
