# Community & Support

ttkbootstrap 2 thrives because of its contributors, users, and helpful discussions. This page lists the places you can ask questions, report issues, and contribute patches or documentation improvements.

## Discussion channels

- **GitHub Discussions** hosts usage questions, layout tips, and prototype reviews with a community that stays close to the release train.
- **Discord/Matrix** (when available) surfaces real-time pairing sessions, quick triage, and conversation around upcoming features.
- **Stack Overflow** keeps the most common troubleshooting answers visible; tag posts with `ttkbootstrap` so other users can find them.

## Reporting issues

1. Search the existing issues before filing a new one so duplicates do not slow the maintainers down.
2. Share a minimal reproduction (code snippet, theme, Python version, traceback) so the bug can be validated quickly.
3. Tag the report with the right label (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.) and mention `Python 3.10+` if it is part of the context.

## Contribution workflow

- Fork the repository, work in a feature branch, and keep commits focused (docs, widgets, tests, tooling updates).
- Run the available checks (`python -m pytest` when configured, or the `ttkbootstrap dev` CLI once it ships) before opening a pull request.
- Improve docs, examples, or templates when you spot outdated guidance; every page in Getting Started benefits from new clarity.

## Support tiers

- **Self-serve**: Read the Getting Started section, the Guides, and explore the Showcase until you feel confident.
- **Community support**: Lean on Discussions, chats, and the repo issue tracker when you need extra context or pair-programming help.
- **Professional services**: Reach out to the maintainers if you need paid consulting, onboarding, or workshops for your team.
