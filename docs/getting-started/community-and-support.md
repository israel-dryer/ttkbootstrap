## Discussion channels

- **GitHub Discussions** — Ask usage questions, seek guidance on complex layouts, and share prototypes with the community.
- **Discord / Matrix** — Real-time chat (if the project opens a channel) helps with pairing and quick triage.

## Reporting issues

1. Search existing GitHub issues before filing a new one.
2. Provide a minimal reproduction (code snippet, error trace, current theme).
3. Tag the issue with `documentation`, `bug`, or `enhancement` to speed discovery.

## Contribution

- Fork the repo, make improvements (docs, widgets, tests), and open a pull request.
- Use the `ttkbootstrap dev` CLI (when available) to run checks before submitting.
- Review the coding guidelines in `development/issues` for formatting and test expectations.

## Support tiers

- **Self-serve** — Use this documentation plus the Showcase examples to learn at your own pace.
- **Community support** — Leverage Discussions or chat channels for mentorship.
- **Professional services** — Contact the maintainers directly if you need paid consulting or workshops.
