# Design System

ttkbootstrap includes a built-in **design system** that defines how applications
look, feel, and behave visually—independent of individual widgets.

The design system establishes a shared visual language across the framework,
covering color semantics, variants, typography, and icons.

Rather than styling widgets individually, ttkbootstrap applications express
*intent* using design tokens. The framework ensures those intentions are rendered
consistently across themes, platforms, and screen densities.

## What the Design System Is

The design system defines:

- **semantic colors** (meaning, not appearance)
- **visual variants** (emphasis and affordance)
- **typography tokens** (hierarchy and readability)
- **iconography rules** (symbolic, theme-aware icons)

These rules apply uniformly across all widgets.

## What the Design System Is Not

The design system does **not**:

- explain how to use widgets  
- document APIs or parameters  
- provide step-by-step tutorials  

Those topics are covered elsewhere:

- Widget behavior → [Widgets](../widgets/index.md)
- Application workflows → [Guides](../guides/index.md)
- Framework mechanics → [Capabilities](../capabilities/index.md)

## Why ttkbootstrap Is Opinionated

ttkbootstrap intentionally constrains visual choices to reduce inconsistency
and design drift.

By adopting the design system:

- applications look cohesive by default
- light/dark themes behave predictably
- widgets share common interaction patterns
- customization remains structured and maintainable

- Learn how color semantics work in [Colors](colors.md)
- Understand emphasis and hierarchy in [Variants](variants.md)
- Explore text styling in [Typography](typography.md)
- See how icons are treated in [Icons](icons.md)

To learn how these concepts are applied in real applications, see
[Guides → Styling](../guides/styling.md).
