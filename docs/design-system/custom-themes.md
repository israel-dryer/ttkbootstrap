# Custom Themes

Custom themes allow you to redefine how the design system is rendered without
changing application code.

Themes map semantic tokens—colors, typography, icons—to concrete visual values.

---

## What themes control

Themes typically define:

- color palettes
- typography mappings
- icon rendering rules
- widget appearance defaults

---

## When to create a custom theme

Create a custom theme when:

- branding requirements differ from built-in themes
- you need fine-grained visual control
- you want to distribute a themed application

---

## Theme scope

Themes apply globally to an application.

Widgets automatically adapt when the theme changes.
