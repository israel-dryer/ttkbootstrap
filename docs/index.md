## Core flows
1. Start with Getting Started to install, compare editions, and open your first themed app.
2. Browse the Widgets catalog to learn the grouping and Bootstyle tokens that drive each control.
3. Read the Design system section to discover how ThemeProvider, Style, and Bootstyle builders orchestrate palettes.
4. Dive into Guides for runtime configuration, signals, events, and packaging advice.
5. Consult the Reference for low-level utilities, CLI helpers, and migration notes.
6. Visit the Showcase for templates, gallery entries, and community stories you can adapt.

## Highlights
- A refreshed design system pairs semantic colors, typography tokens, and ThemeProvider-aware palettes so every widget shares the same intent.
- Reactive signals, virtual-event payloads, and on_/off_ helpers keep callbacks clean while letting widgets stream data.
- PageStack navigation, Form helpers, and upgraded TableView/SelectBox widgets provide modern layouts out of the box.

## Latest updates
- Reactive signal integration now ships with every widget that exposes `textvariable` or `variable`, so validation and binding flows stay consistent.
- Form, FormDialog, ScrollView, and SpinnerEntry joined the catalog while the documentation now mirrors the Bootstyle grouping that drives each release.
