# ttkbootstrap

**ttkbootstrap** is an **opinionated UI framework** for building modern desktop applications with Tk.

It goes far beyond theming or styling. ttkbootstrap provides a cohesive **design system**, a complete
**widget ecosystem**, and a set of **framework-level capabilities**—so you can focus on building
applications instead of wrestling with low-level UI mechanics.

## What ttkbootstrap is

ttkbootstrap is designed for developers who want:

- **Modern UI defaults**  
  Consistent colors, typography, spacing, and variants out of the box.

- **A complete widget ecosystem**  
  Buttons, dialogs, forms, tables, navigation components, and more—designed to work together.

- **Reactivity and state modeling**  
  Signals, events, and state-driven interaction patterns built into the framework.

- **Framework conveniences**  
  Validation, icons & images, localization, layout abstractions, and application patterns.

- **A clear path to shipping apps**  
  Guidance for configuration, runtime behavior, and distribution.

You do *not* need to deeply understand Tk or ttk internals to be productive with ttkbootstrap.

---

## What ttkbootstrap is not

ttkbootstrap is **not**:

- a thin skin on top of tkinter
- a loose collection of themed widgets
- a low-level toolkit that requires you to design everything from scratch

While it builds on Tk/ttk, ttkbootstrap intentionally defines **opinions and defaults** to reduce
decision fatigue and accelerate development.

## Framework layers

ttkbootstrap is organized into clear layers:

- **Platform** — foundational concepts and constraints inherited from Tk/ttk  
  (primarily for understanding, debugging, and extension)

- **Capabilities** — cross-cutting framework features such as signals, validation,
  layout properties, icons, and configuration

- **Design System** — colors, typography, variants, and visual language

- **Widgets** — user-facing components built on top of the platform and capabilities

- **Build & Cookbook** — guidance for assembling, structuring, and shipping applications

Each layer builds on the previous one, forming a cohesive framework rather than a grab bag of tools.

## Who this framework is for

ttkbootstrap is ideal if you want to:

- build desktop apps that feel modern and intentional
- move fast without reinventing UI patterns
- keep visual consistency across an application
- apply reactive and declarative patterns in Tk
- ship polished tools to end users

## Getting started

If you're new to ttkbootstrap:

1. Start with **Getting Started → Quick Start**
2. Browse **Widgets** to see what’s available
3. Learn **Capabilities** to understand how the framework works
4. Use **Build** and **Cookbook** when assembling real applications

You can dive as deep as you want—but you don’t have to.
