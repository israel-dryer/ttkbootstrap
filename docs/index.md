# ttkbootstrap v2 Documentation

Welcome to the ttkbootstrap v2 documentation.

This site helps you design, build, and ship modern desktop applications using Tkinter—without giving up the stability,
portability, and simplicity that make Tk appealing in the first place.

Rather than focusing only on widgets or styling, the documentation is organized around **how applications are meant to
be structured**, so you can move from first window to real application with confidence.

## Start Here

Most users follow a simple path through the documentation:

- **Getting Started**  
  Install ttkbootstrap, learn the core concepts, and launch your first themed application.

- **Widgets**  
  Explore inputs, data display, navigation, feedback, and layout widgets—grouped by purpose, not alphabetically.

- **Design System**  
  Understand the color tokens, typography roles, layout principles, theming, and localization rules that keep
  applications consistent.

- **Guides**  
  Learn application-level patterns such as runtime configuration, signals and events, forms and dialogs, and packaging
  for distribution.

- **Reference**  
  Look up APIs, utilities, CLI tools, and migration notes when you need exact details.

- **Showcase**  
  Browse templates, real projects, and case studies to see how the pieces come together.

## How the Docs Are Organized

The documentation mirrors how ttkbootstrap itself is designed:

1. **Concepts before APIs**  
   You’ll learn *why* patterns exist before seeing how to implement them.

2. **Purpose-driven navigation**  
   Widgets and features are grouped by intent—inputs, feedback, layout, navigation—not by module paths.

3. **Design as a system**  
   Styling, layout, and behavior are treated as coordinated parts of a whole, not isolated configuration options.

This structure is intentional. It’s designed to help you build applications that scale beyond small demos.

## What ttkbootstrap v2 Provides

At a high level, ttkbootstrap v2 gives you:

- A cohesive design system built on semantic colors, typography tokens, and theme-aware variants
- A rich widget catalog covering common desktop UI patterns
- Structured helpers for forms, dialogs, navigation, and feedback
- Reactive signals and event utilities that reduce callback boilerplate
- Built-in support for localization, theming, and runtime customization
- Documentation that explains design intent—not just usage syntax

All of this is built directly on top of standard Tkinter and `ttk`.

## Where to Go Next

If you’re new, start with **Getting Started** and build a small application.

If you’re already comfortable with Tkinter, jump directly to **Widgets** or the **Design System** to see what
ttkbootstrap adds.

If you’re preparing an application for distribution, head to **Guides** for packaging and deployment patterns.

## Summary

ttkbootstrap v2 is designed to help you build desktop applications that feel intentional, consistent, and
maintainable—without abandoning the strengths of Tkinter.

The documentation is your guide to that structure.
