# Guides

Guides teach you **how to build applications** with ttkbootstrap.

While other documentation sections explain *what things are*, Guides show you *how to use them together* to solve real problems.

---

## What Guides Are

Guides are **workflow-oriented** documentation.

They demonstrate:

- patterns and decisions
- how widgets and capabilities work together
- practical examples you can adapt
- the "why" behind common approaches

Guides assume you understand the basics. They focus on **showing**, not explaining from scratch.

---

## What Guides Are Not

Guides do not replace:

- **Widget docs** — detailed per-widget reference and options
- **Capabilities docs** — how framework features work internally
- **API Reference** — method signatures and parameters
- **Platform docs** — Tk/ttk fundamentals and behavior

If you need to understand *what* a widget does, see [Widgets](../widgets/index.md).
If you need to understand *how* a capability works, see [Capabilities](../capabilities/index.md).
Guides show you *how to apply* that knowledge.

## How to Use Guides

Guides are meant to be read **after** you've explored the basics.

1. Start with a Guide that matches your current task
2. Follow the examples and adapt them
3. Use the linked Widget and Capability docs for details
4. Return to Guides when you encounter new patterns

Guides are not tutorials—they assume you can read code and explore on your own.
