Styling with bootstyle
======================

Every ttkbootstrap widget is styled through one keyword: ``bootstyle``. You give
it a short string that names *intent* — a color, a variant, a surface — and the
theme renders it correctly in light and dark without hard-coding a single hex
value. This guide covers everything that string can express.

.. code-block:: python

   import ttkbootstrap as ttk

   app = ttk.App()

   ttk.Button(app, text="Save",   bootstyle="success").pack()
   ttk.Button(app, text="Cancel", bootstyle="secondary outline").pack()
   ttk.Button(app, text="Delete", bootstyle="danger ghost").pack()

   app.mainloop()

The slots
---------

A ``bootstyle`` value is a single string of space-separated tokens in a fixed
slot order::

   [@surface] [color] [variant] <base-type> [orient]

- **@surface** — the surface the control sits on: ``@card`` (a neutral raised
  panel) or an accent (``@primary`` …), so a ghost, outline, or link control
  blends on a card or an accent bar instead of only the window background.
  Optional and position-free.
- **color** — the semantic intent: ``primary``, ``secondary``, ``success``,
  ``info``, ``warning``, ``danger``, ``light``, ``dark``, ``neutral``.
- **variant** — a look such as ``outline``, ``link``, ``ghost``, ``round``,
  ``striped``.
- **base-type** — the widget family. Usually inferred from the widget, so you
  leave it out; you spell it only for the chameleon families ``toggle`` /
  ``toolbutton`` (see below).
- **orient** — ``horizontal`` / ``vertical``, inferred from the widget where it
  applies.

Every slot is optional. A bare widget with no ``bootstyle`` takes the theme's
default look — for the **button family** (``Button``, ``Menubutton``, and the
``toolbutton`` variant) that default is ``neutral``, a quiet no-accent fill;
other widgets use their standard theme style. Each token you add refines it.

Building up a style
-------------------

Start with a **color** — the widget picks the right shape from its own class:

.. code-block:: python

   ttk.Button(app, text="Go", bootstyle="primary")
   ttk.Label(app, text="Heads up", bootstyle="warning")
   ttk.Progressbar(app, bootstyle="success")   # orient inferred → horizontal

.. admonition:: 📷 Screenshot (placeholder)
   :class: screenshot-placeholder

   A row of buttons in the semantic colors — primary, secondary, success, info,
   warning, danger — light and dark themes side by side.

Add a **variant** to change visual weight. The color still leads:

.. code-block:: python

   ttk.Button(app, text="Solid",   bootstyle="primary")
   ttk.Button(app, text="Outline", bootstyle="primary outline")
   ttk.Button(app, text="Link",    bootstyle="primary link")
   ttk.Button(app, text="Ghost",   bootstyle="primary ghost")

.. admonition:: 📷 Screenshot (placeholder)
   :class: screenshot-placeholder

   The same primary color as solid, outline, link, and ghost buttons in a row —
   showing the four visual weights at a glance.

You can drop the color as well — a bare ``outline`` button uses ``primary``:

.. code-block:: python

   ttk.Button(app, text="Outline", bootstyle="outline")   # primary outline

Point a control at a **surface** with an ``@`` token so it blends on a card or an
accent bar instead of the window background:

.. code-block:: python

   card = ttk.Frame(app, bootstyle="card", padding=12)
   ttk.Button(card, text="More", bootstyle="@card primary ghost")

Chameleon base-types
--------------------

Two variants aren't tied to one widget class, so you name the **base-type**
explicitly. ``toggle`` turns a ``Checkbutton`` into a switch; ``toolbutton``
turns a ``Button`` (or ``Checkbutton``) into a pressed-state toolbar button:

.. code-block:: python

   ttk.Checkbutton(app, text="Wi-Fi", bootstyle="success round toggle")
   ttk.Checkbutton(app, text="Bold",  bootstyle="toolbutton")

How it resolves
---------------

``bootstyle`` is a compact spelling of the underlying **ttk style name**. The
tokens map onto the dotted name ttk actually uses:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - ``bootstyle``
     - ttk style name
   * - ``primary outline``
     - ``primary.Outline.TButton``
   * - ``success round toggle``
     - ``success.Round.Toggle``
   * - ``info striped``
     - ``info.Striped.Horizontal.TProgressbar``

Because of that, ``bootstyle="primary outline"`` and the raw
``style="primary.Outline.TButton"`` are interchangeable — ``bootstyle`` just
saves you from spelling the base-type, orientation, and casing. The full mapping
per widget is in the :doc:`Style Reference </reference/style-reference/index>`.

Tokens are **order-free** and **separator-flexible**: ``"outline primary"`` and
``"primary-outline"`` resolve the same as ``"primary outline"``. Spaces are the
recommended spelling — they read best and are what editor autocomplete suggests.

When a token is wrong
---------------------

The parser is a tokenizer over a **closed vocabulary**, so a typo doesn't
silently produce the wrong style — it fails loudly. By default an unknown token
warns (and suggests the nearest match) and the widget falls back to a valid
style:

.. code-block:: python

   ttk.Button(app, bootstyle="primatry")   # UserWarning: did you mean 'primary'?

To make unknown tokens raise instead — useful in tests and CI — turn on strict
mode, globally or per environment:

.. code-block:: python

   from ttkbootstrap import set_bootstyle_strict

   set_bootstyle_strict(True)               # or set TTKBOOTSTRAP_STRICT=1

Note that ttkbootstrap is permissive about *valid* choices: a control on its own
matching accent surface may render low-contrast, but that is a real style, so it
is allowed — only misspelled or unknown tokens fail.

Beyond the grammar
------------------

When you need a look the grammar can't name — a bespoke color, a custom element
layout — you register your own ttk style and apply it with ``style=``. See
:doc:`Custom styles </user-guide/feature-guides/custom-styles>`.

The rest of this page is the full vocabulary and every registered widget family,
generated from the closed vocabulary and the builder registry.
